/**
 * The projects of one workspace, built the same way wherever they are read.
 *
 * Every workspace holding spec files owns a `vitest.config.ts` that calls this
 * and exports the result twice: as `projects`, which the root config spreads,
 * and as a default `defineConfig`, which is what a standalone `vitest run`
 * inside that workspace loads. One definition, two entry points, so
 * `yarn test` and `yarn w <workspace> test` cannot disagree about what a
 * workspace's tests are.
 *
 * ⚠️ The entries returned here are FLAT, and they have to stay that way. A
 * project config that declares `projects` of its own is not nested, it is
 * silently ignored: the parent collapses it into a single project, keeps the
 * parent's own `test` block, and runs every spec under it. Measured, not
 * assumed. That is what a browser spec running in the `node` environment looks
 * like, and it is why the jsdom half is a sibling entry here rather than a
 * nested project inside each workspace.
 *
 * Settings are stamped into every entry rather than inherited with
 * `extends: true`. Inheritance would resolve against the root config from the
 * root and against the workspace config standalone, which is two different
 * answers for the same project.
 *
 * ⚠️ So every entry says `extends: false`, and has to. Vitest 5 flipped the
 * default: an inline project now inherits its declaring config unless told
 * otherwise, which is exactly the two-answers problem above arriving silently.

 * the server build (`ViteUtils.createTsconfigPathsPlugin`), and Vitest was the
 * one runtime that did not, so every workspace using `@/` had to restate the

 * repo-wide, pointing at `apps/lore/src` - which would have resolved the first
 * `@/` import written in `examples/shop` into Lore's source, silently.
 *
 * ⚠️ A path whose prefix is the workspace's OWN package name is skipped. Those
 * exist for TypeScript alone; the package's `exports` map already resolves the
 * same specifier and does it better, because an alias is applied before
 * conditions are and would flatten `browser` and `types` down to one file.
 * `@alepha/lore/sigil` is the live case: aliasing it hands a jsdom spec
 * `index.ts` where the exports map gives `index.browser.ts`.
