/**
 * Measures the self-hosted Lore image and holds it to a budget.
 *
 * ## What "200 MB" means here
 *
 * It is the COMPRESSED size: the number of bytes `docker pull` actually
 * downloads, summed over the layer blobs in the OCI manifest. That is the
 * only figure a self-hoster experiences, and it is the only one this script
 * gates on.
 *
 * The alternative reading, the unpacked size on disk, would already be blown
 * by the base image alone, so a budget expressed that way is not a ceiling,
 * it is a number that has to be doubled before it can be met at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Do not measure this with `docker image inspect .Size` or the `docker
 * images` SIZE column.** What those report depends on which image store the
 * daemon runs: under the classic graph driver `.Size` is the UNCOMPRESSED
 * total, under the containerd store it is closer to the compressed one, and
 * the `docker images` column disagrees with both when a build produced
 * several platform variants. Measured on one machine on 2026-09-02, the same
 * image read as 314 MB (`docker images`), 75.6 MB (`inspect .Size`) and
 * 77.6 MB (this script). Only the last one is what a pull costs.
 *
 * Building both platforms is not only a measurement: it is the only place
 * outside a dispatched Release where the multi-arch build the release
 * performs is exercised at all.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/docker-size.ts [--budget-mb 200] [--context apps/lore/dist]
