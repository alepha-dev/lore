/**
 * Driving Lore from another Alepha server.
 *
 * The third half of this package. `@alepha/lore/sigil` is what a running app
 * reports WITH, `@alepha/lore/cli` is what a pipeline runs, and this is what an
 * application calls when its environments have a lifecycle of their own: one
 * deployed copy per tenant, per branch, per customer.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const alepha = Alepha.create().with(AlephaLoreClient);
 * const lore = alepha.inject(LoreDeployService);
 *
 * // A club owner signs up with the slug "wassup":
 * const { url } = await lore.deploy({
 *   app: "club",
 *   env: "wassup",
 *   tag: "latest",
 *   domain: "wassup.club.example",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Configured by the same three variables CI already sets - `LORE_URL`,
 * `LORE_API_KEY`, `LORE_PROJECT` - so one deployment configures both halves.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why this is not `$client<DeployController>`
 *
 * `$client<T>` puts `T` into this package's exported signatures, and `T` here
 * would come from the `lore` workspace, which is `private` and never
 * published. `scripts/check-dts.ts` fails the build on exactly that, so the
 * failure lands on us rather than on whoever installs the tarball.
 *
 * `@alepha/lore/cli` uses `$client` freely because a binary's types stay
 * internal; a library's return types ARE its interface. So this addresses
 * endpoints by path and declares its own result shapes, the way
 * `ArtifactUploader` already does. `LoreApiClient` is the one class that knows
 * a path, so there is one place to look when Lore moves one.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ No filesystem, no `node:` anything
 *
 * There is no token store here and no device flow: those are for a laptop, and
 * a server holds an API key. That is what keeps this subpath importable from a
 * Cloudflare Worker, which is where an app that provisions tenants on demand is
 * most likely to run.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ It does not build, and it never will
 *
 * Lore's Worker cannot run Vite, so an artifact is always produced on the
 * machine holding the source. `lore apps build` and `lore artifacts push`
 * belong in CI; this ships bytes that already exist and refuses when the tag
 * names none.
