/**
 * CLI plugin for talking to a Lore instance from a build or a CI job.
 *
 * The other half of this package reports from a running app; this half is what
 * a pipeline runs. It lives here rather than in `alepha/cli` because Lore is a
 * superset of Alepha and no Lore code belongs inside the framework, and it is
 * a subpath rather than a package of its own so that both halves share one
 * answer to "where is Lore, and how do I authenticate to it".
 *
 * Registered from `alepha.config.ts`, the same way `alepha/cli/vendor` is:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { lore } from "@alepha/lore/cli";
 *
 * export default defineConfig({
 *   plugins: [lore({ project: "alepha" })],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ⚠️ This subpath carries no `browser` export condition, on purpose. A bundler
 * that resolves it has wandered somewhere it does not belong, and should fail
 * on the first `node:` import rather than be handed a stub.
 *
 * @module alepha.lore.cli
