/**
 * Regression coverage for the cross-request contamination found in
 * `StateManager.register()`.
 *
 * `$cookie({ key: atom.key })` writes the raw cookie into the request's ALS
 * layer during `server:onRequest`, BEFORE anything ever reads the atom. So on
 * a request that carries the cookie, the atom's very first registration
 * happens inside a fork that already holds its key — and the app-level store
 * never received the declared default. Every later, cookie-LESS request then
 * resolved `undefined` (no fork value, no app value) instead of the default:
 * one user's cookied request permanently defined what every cookie-less user
 * saw.
 *
 * The atom is deliberately NOT declared with `$store(...)` here: it must
 * register lazily, from inside the request, which is exactly what the
 * framework's own `uiAtom` does during SSR.
