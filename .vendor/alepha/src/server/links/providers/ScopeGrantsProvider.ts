/**
 * What the viewer may do inside the scope the UI is currently rendering.
 *
 * `LinkProvider.can("createQuest")` answers one question today: is that action
 * in the registry the server sent me. The server prunes an action whose
 * `$secure` permissions the caller's roles do not carry, so that answer is
 * **application scope** - it is the same for every project, team or workspace
 * the viewer can open.
 *
 * An application where a member's powers vary per resource needs a second
 * question answered by the same call, or every screen has to remember to ask
 * twice and the ones that forget render a button that 403s. That is what this
 * provider is: `can()` consults it, and its default says there is no scope, so
 * an application that never substitutes it gets exactly today's answers.
 *
 * ## Synchronous, on purpose
 *
 * `can()` runs during render, on the server and in the browser, and the two
 * have to agree or the markup drifts on hydration. So the scope's permission
 * set is something the page's loader has already put somewhere readable - an
 * atom, typically - and this reads it. It is not a place to fetch from.
 *
 * ```ts
 * class ProjectScopeGrants extends ScopeGrantsProvider {
 *   protected readonly alepha = $inject(Alepha);
 *
 *   public override current(): readonly string[] | undefined {
 *     return this.alepha.store.get(currentProjectAtom)?.permissions;
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * alepha.with({ provide: ScopeGrantsProvider, use: ProjectScopeGrants });
 * ```
 */
export class ScopeGrantsProvider {
  /**
   * The permissions the viewer holds in the scope being rendered, or
   * `undefined` when there is no scope.
   *
   * ⚠️ `undefined` and `[]` are different answers. `undefined` means "not
   * inside a scope", so the application-scope registry is the whole answer and
   * nothing is filtered. `[]` means "inside a scope, holding nothing", which
   * hides every action that names a permission. Returning `[]` for a page
   * outside any scope would blank the entire UI.
   *
   * An entry ending in `*` grants every permission with that prefix, matching
   * how a wildcard reads everywhere else in this framework.
