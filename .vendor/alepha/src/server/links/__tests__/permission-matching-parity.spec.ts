/**
 * `PermissionRegistryProvider` duplicates the permission-matching rule from
 * `LinkProvider.can()` on purpose: `alepha/security` cannot import
 * `alepha/server/links` at runtime without closing the module cycle
 * `security -> server/links -> security`, which the build's analyzer rejects.
 *
 * Duplicated logic drifts unless something holds it together, so this pins the
 * two against each other. `$secure` in the browser and `useAuth().has` must
 * never disagree about whether a caller holds a permission — a guard that
 * denies what the UI shows (or vice versa) is worse than either behaviour on
 * its own.
 *
 * Only permission-shaped names are compared. `LinkProvider.can()` also resolves
 * bare action names against its action map, which is not a permission question
 * and has no counterpart on the security side.
