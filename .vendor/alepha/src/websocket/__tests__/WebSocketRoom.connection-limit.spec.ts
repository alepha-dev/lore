/**
 * `maxConnectionsPerUser` used to be a Node-only option: the Durable Object
 * never counted anything, so the cap simply did not exist on workerd while
 * the guide said it did.
 *
 * The DO owns every socket in its room, hibernated ones included, so the
 * count is exact there - and that is also why the cap is PER ROOM on this
 * engine, which the guide now states.
 *
 * Both halves are covered: the counting on its own, and the upgrade path in
 * `fetch` that has to act on it. Reaching `fetch` at all needs the two
 * workerd-only lines stubbed - `WebSocketPair` is a Workers global and Node's
 * `Response` rejects a 101 status - which is what {@link TestWebSocketRoom}
 * does. Every other WebSocketRoom spec avoids `fetch` entirely, and that gap
 * is exactly where a limit could be counted and then not applied.
