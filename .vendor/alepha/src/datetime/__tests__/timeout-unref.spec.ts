 * A timeout holds the event loop open until it fires, which is right for work
 * and wrong for housekeeping. `lore quality push` finished its push in
 * 3 seconds and then sat there for 5 minutes, because one cached GET had armed
 * a refed eviction timer for the 300s default TTL.
 *
 * `hasRef()` is Node's own answer to "would this keep the process alive", so
 * these assert the thing that actually matters rather than a flag we set.
