/**
 * Resource-scoped authorization gate.
 *
 * Roles and permissions answer "what kind of user is this?". They cannot
 * answer "does this user own row 42?", so that check ends up inline in every
 * handler - where nothing enforces its presence and a forgotten call is a
 * silent authorization hole.
 *
 * `$owns` loads the row named by a route param, checks the caller against it,
 * and publishes it via `OwnedResourceProvider` so the handler does not
 * re-fetch what the gate already read. An application whose request does not
 * name the row - a single-tenant deployment with exactly one container -
 * computes the id with {@link OwnsOptions.resolve} instead.
 *
 * Three checks, applied in order:
 *
 * 1. **Owner**: `row[owner] === user.id`.
 * 2. **Membership**: when `via` is set, a row in the join entity links the
 *    caller to this resource.
 * 3. **Grant**: when `requires` is set, {@link ResourceGrantsProvider} says
 *    whether the caller holds that permission INSIDE this resource. Its
 *    default answers allow, so an application that never substitutes it
 *    behaves exactly as it did before the option existed.
 *
 * Both are read off the row the param names, unless `through` says ownership
 * lives one hop away - on the project a quest belongs to, say. The resource
 * is still published to `OwnedResourceProvider.get()`; the row the decision
 * was actually made against is published to `authority()`.
 *
 * A privileged identity (`user.ownership === false`) bypasses both, matching
 * the `ownership` semantics `$secure` already applies: an admin whose grant is
 * not narrowed to rows they own. Note this is deliberately strict - an
 * `undefined` ownership does **not** bypass, because `undefined` only means
 * "no permission check ran", not "this caller is privileged".
 *
 * ```typescript
 * class CampaignController {
 *   read = $action({
 *     path: "/campaigns/:id",
 *     use: [
 *       $secure(),
 *       $owns({
 *         repository: () => this.campaigns,
