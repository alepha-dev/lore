/**
 * Create a new permission.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ A permission's id is `group:name`, and it is a stable string
 *
 * Whatever grants this permission - a role, a stored profile, a per-resource
 * rank - stores that string. So `group` and `name` are an external identity,
 * not a label: renaming either one silently re-points every grant that held
 * the old string, and nothing anywhere goes red.
 *
 * The corollary is that an id must never be DERIVED from position. A
 * catalogue that numbers its permissions by their index in an array re-maps
 * every stored grant the moment somebody inserts one in the middle - and the
 * grants that move are not the ones being edited. This has a worked example:
 * a club whose receptionists woke up able to delete tournaments.
 *
 * Say what the permission is called with {@link PermissionPrimitiveOptions.label};
 * that is the string a reader sees, and it can be changed freely.
