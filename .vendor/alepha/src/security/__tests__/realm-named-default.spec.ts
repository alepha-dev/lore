/**
 * `createRealm` drops the placeholder realm the provider invents for a test
 * container, so an application's own realms are the only ones registered.
 *
 * It used to recognise that placeholder BY NAME (`realms[0].name ===
 * "default"`), which made an application realm called `default`
 * indistinguishable from it: declaring a second realm silently threw the
 * first one away. Nothing failed at boot. The failure surfaced far from its
 * cause, as a 500 at token minting reading `No secret key found in the
 * keystore`, because the discarded realm never had its signing key
 * registered.
 *
 * `default` is a natural name for an application to pick, and it was
 * `DEFAULT_USER_REALM_NAME` itself until #Q2264 renamed that to `users`, so
 * every app upgraded with `issuer: { name: "default" }` pinned declares one.
