 * the *normal* tier, and tiers resolve first → normal → last. Move security to
 * `first` and every cookie-borne session resolves to nobody — the request goes
 * anonymous and `$secure` refuses it.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. It shipped, and it took two Playwright uploads
 * failing to find it, because a bearer token still worked and only the cookie
 * path broke. A docblock here once claimed resolution "takes only `url` and
 * `headers`, so it cannot want a body that has not been parsed yet" — true
 * about the body, wrong about what it does want.
