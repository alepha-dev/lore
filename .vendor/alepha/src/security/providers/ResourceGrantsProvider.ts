/**
 * The seam between {@link $owns} and whatever decides what a member may do
 * INSIDE the resource they belong to.
 *
 * `$owns` answers a boolean: are you the owner of this row, or a member of it
 * through the join. That is the whole question for most applications, and for
 * those this provider is never replaced and never costs anything.
 *
 * An application that gives its members different powers - a viewer, a
 * contributor, an administrator - needs a second answer, and it needs it from
 * the same gate: a rule split across a middleware and a hand-written check in
 * the handler is a rule with two versions of itself. `requires` on
 * {@link OwnsOptions} names the permission at the call site, and this provider
 * is what turns the rows the gate already read into an allow or a deny.
 *
 * ## Rows, never ids
 *
 * {@link ResourceGrantsRequest} carries the **authority row** and the
 * **membership row** the gate loaded, not their ids. That is deliberate and it
 * is the whole performance contract: an implementation cannot go and query for
 * the assignment, because it was never handed anything to query with. The
 * assignment has to be a column on a row the gate already reads, so a plain
 * member costs zero extra reads per request.
 *
 * ## The default is today's behaviour
 *
 * Allow. An application that never registers a replacement behaves exactly as
 * it did before `requires` existed, whether or not its call sites use the
 * option. Substitute it the way every other seam in this framework is
 * substituted:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { RankGrantsProvider } from "alepha/api/organizations";
 *
 * alepha.with({ provide: ResourceGrantsProvider, use: RankGrantsProvider });
 * ```
