/**
 * The page and the endpoint an unsubscribe link points at.
 *
 * **A `$route`, not an `$action`.** `$action` lives under `/api`, which mail
 * clients and one-click POSTs have no business reaching, and the `$action`
 * dispatcher shadows anything under `/api/*` anyway. This is a root path.
 *
 * **Unauthenticated by design.** Someone arriving from a six-month-old email
 * has no session, and the app's SPA may be behind a login they cannot pass.
 * The token is the credential, and it is the only input this controller
 * trusts: no cookie, no session, no current tenant.
