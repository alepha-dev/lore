/**
 * Notification jobs + runtime-editable retention.
 *
 * - `settings` - the `$parameter` from {@link NotificationSettings}, holding
 *   the retention windows and the stored-body switch. Admins change them at
 *   runtime; the values propagate across instances via the parameter pub/sub
 *   and the next trim or purge picks them up with no restart.
 * - `sendNotification` - queue-mode, audit-oriented. Every execution is kept
 *   for `retentionDays`, successes and failures alike, however many there
 *   are. The job's `retention` reads the parameter through a function, so the
 *   jobs module's hourly trim applies the window an operator set, and nothing
 *   else deletes these rows.
 * - `purgeOldNotifications` - hourly sweep that deletes expired delivery
 *   receipts, then read inbox messages. Clocks of their own, on purpose: the
 *   outbox is short (7 days) and the receipts are long (90), because a
 *   complaint can arrive after the outbox row is gone; the inbox has its own
 *   because a read message is one the reader has already dealt with, and an
 *   unread one is never swept at all.
 *
 * Cron expression note: the purge cron is declared statically (`0 * * * *`)
 * because some runtimes (Cloudflare Workers) freeze cron triggers at deploy
 * time. The retention windows are the knob that actually matters for
 * operators, and those are runtime-editable.
