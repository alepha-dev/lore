/**
 * Creates a notification primitive: a delivery template, pushed through a
 * durable outbox.
 *
 * Provides type-safe, reusable notification templates with multi-language
 * support, variable substitution, and categorization.
 *
 * **The channel set is open.** `email` and `sms` are the two the framework
 * ships, and each is one `NotificationChannel` service among however many the
 * container registers. A package outside the framework adds its own key by
 * declaration merging on {@link NotificationChannels}, and a template that
 * names a channel nothing provides refuses to boot rather than silently
 * sending nothing.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * class NotificationTemplates {
 *   welcomeEmail = $notification({
 *     name: "welcome-email",
 *     category: "onboarding",
 *     schema: z.object({ username: z.text(), activationLink: z.text() }),
 *     email: {
 *       subject: "Welcome to our platform!",
 *       body: (vars) => `Hello ${vars.username}, click: ${vars.activationLink}`
 *     }
 *   });
 *
 *   async sendWelcome(user: User) {
 *     await this.welcomeEmail.push({
 *       variables: { username: user.name, activationLink: generateLink() },
 *       contact: user.email
