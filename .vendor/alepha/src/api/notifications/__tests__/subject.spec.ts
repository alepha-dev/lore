/**
 * A subject may be built from the template's variables, exactly like a body.
 *
 * It could not be, for as long as the primitive existed: `subject` was typed
 * `string` while `body` and `text` beside it took a function of the
 * variables. The subject is the line a phone shows in its notification, so a
 * sign-in code that is not in it is a code somebody has to open a mail client
 * to read - which is why one real message stayed on a bare `$email.send` for
 * a fortnight while every other one moved onto `$notification`.
 *
 * A plain string still takes the branch it always did, so no existing
 * template changes behaviour. The specs below pin both halves.
