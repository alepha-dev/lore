/**
 * One delivery channel, and the extension point of the whole module.
 *
 * A channel is a **service**, not a primitive: it has dependencies (an http
 * client, an options atom, a boot-time config check) and this codebase
 * models transports as services. Discovery is `alepha.services()`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A channel must be listed in its module's `services[]`.**
 * `alepha.services()` walks the registry and filters on `instanceof`, so it
 * sees *instantiated* services only: a channel that is exported but never
 * injected is invisible, and the symptom is the boot check refusing a
 * template that declares your own channel.
 *
 * ## What a plugin has to declare
 *
 * A channel is three things, not one: the class below, the option block a
 * template writes, and, for a sink, the fact that it is one. The last two are
 * declaration merges, and they belong in the package's single entry point,
 * because an augmentation only applies where it is in scope.
 *
 * ```ts
 * declare module "alepha/api/notifications" {
 *   interface NotificationChannels<V> {
 *     discord?: { to?: string; message: (v: V) => string | Promise<string> };
 *   }
 *   interface NotificationSinkChannels {
 *     discord: true;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Declaring only the first compiles, and then `push()` keeps demanding a
 * `contact` for a message going to a chatroom.
 *
 * ## Two members that look optional and are not
 *
 * `render()` must return a **`recipient`**. It is not decoration: the sender
 * writes it straight into `notification_deliveries.contact`, which is
 * `NOT NULL`, and it is the only reason the sender never has to ask what kind
 * of channel it is talking to. An addressable channel returns the contact it
 * was given; a sink returns `<channel>:<destination>`.
 *
 * **`providerName()`** should be overridden by any channel that is an adapter
 * over a swappable transport, to name that transport. The default is the
 * channel's own class name, which is right for a channel that IS its
 * transport and wrong for one that wraps a provider: without the override,
 * every receipt records `NotificationEmailChannel` where an operator is
 * looking for `BrevoEmailProvider`. Nothing asserts on that field by default,
 * so getting it wrong degrades the audit trail silently.
 *
 * @example A sink channel in a plugin package
 * ```ts
 * export class DiscordNotificationChannel extends NotificationChannel<DiscordMessage> {
 *   public readonly channel = "discord";
 *   public readonly addressable = false;
 *
 *   public async render(input: NotificationRenderInput<DiscordMessage>) {
 *     const to = input.message.to ?? "default";
 *     return { recipient: `discord:${to}`, body: await resolve(input) };
 *   }
 *
 *   public async send(rendered: DiscordRendered) {
 *     // POST to the webhook
 *     return {};
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

   * destination that resolves to nothing is the same situation as a contact
   * that does.
   *
   * Returning a reason writes ONE `skipped` receipt and ends the job `ok`.
   * That is the whole point: the alternative available to a channel today is
   * to throw from `render()`, which is called outside the sender's attempt
   * wrapper, so it writes no receipt at all and the job retries a contact
   * that will never resolve, burning every attempt down to a terminal
   * failure.
   *
   * `recipient` comes back with the reason because the receipt's `contact`
   * column is `NOT NULL`, and a channel that cannot resolve a user still
   * knows the string it was handed.
   *
   * ⚠️ **The admin preview does not consult this.**
   * `AdminNotificationController.preview` calls the sender's `render()`
   * directly, with no gate, so previewing a message whose recipient has
   * since disappeared reaches a `render()` that cannot resolve anybody. It
   * throws, and the preview reports `template-missing` where the template is
   * in fact fine. That is deliberate: widening the preview resource's
   * `reason` for a rare row on a deleted account costs a schema change and a
   * UI branch in `@alepha/ui`, for a more precise label on a screen an
   * operator reaches once a quarter.
