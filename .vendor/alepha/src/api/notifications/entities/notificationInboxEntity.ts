/**
 * One message sitting in somebody's inbox.
 *
 * Distinct from `notification_deliveries` on purpose, and the two are not
 * interchangeable: a receipt is an audit record of one channel attempt, on a
 * 90-day clock, written whether or not anybody will ever look at it. A row
 * here is a message a person can read, click and dismiss, and its lifetime
 * is the product's, not the operator's.
 *
 * ## `userId` is a bare uuid with no foreign key
 *
 * The writer runs inside a job, and this module deliberately imports nothing
 * from `alepha/api/users`, so there is no table here to point at.
 * The cost is orphan rows when an account is deleted, and the app pays it:
 * `NotificationInboxService.deleteForUser()` from the app's own
 * `user:delete:before` handler. Nothing here cascades, so a module that
 * "fixes" this into a real foreign key has coupled two modules that share
 * nothing.
 *
 * ## An unread message is kept forever
 *
 * The hourly sweep removes READ messages past `inboxRetentionDays` and
 * leaves unread ones alone at any age. That is the correct behaviour - a
 * message that waited for you is the feature - and it does mean the table is
 * unbounded for an account that never opens its inbox. If that ever matters,
 * the answer is a second and much longer window for unread rows, never a
 * shorter one for read.
 *
 * ## `scope` and `scopeLabel` are opaque, and stay that way
 *
 * `scope` is an app-owned string (`project:65`). The framework stores it and
 * filters on **equality**; it never parses it and nothing here may branch on
 * its value. That is what lets one project-agnostic table serve a
 * project-filtered URL, and it is the same discipline `app_instances.env`
 * keeps.
 *
 * `scopeLabel` exists because opacity has a cost: nothing in the chain can
 * turn `project:65` into "Alepha". The framework cannot, and a shared
 * component cannot either - the inbox is cross-project, so even an app-side
 * resolver would be asked about projects the current page knows nothing
 * about. So the pusher writes the readable string too, and the framework
 * stores a second string it never parses. Frozen at send time, which is
 * correct: a message is the record of a moment, so a renamed project keeps
 * the name it had when it pinged you.
