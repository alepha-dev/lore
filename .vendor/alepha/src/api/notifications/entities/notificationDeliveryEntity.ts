 * never gets a message id, and NULLs never collide in a unique index, so
 * keying on the provider's id would have deduped nothing on exactly the rows
 * that matter. `executionId` is stable across a job's retries (the job layer
 * updates one row rather than creating three), which makes one receipt per
 * notification instead of one per attempt.
 *
 * **No foreign key to `job_executions`.** The outbox row is purged after
 * `retentionDays` (7 by default) and a complaint can arrive on day 9, so the
 * receipt outlives what it points at and keeps its own 90-day clock.
