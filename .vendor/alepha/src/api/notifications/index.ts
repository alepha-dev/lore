/**
 * User notification management.
 *
 * **Features:**
 * - Notification definitions (email/SMS templates)
 * - Delivery via `$job` with retry and an audit trail kept for `retentionDays`
 * - Runtime-editable retention window via `$parameter` - the jobs trim reads it live
 * - Admin API for inspecting sent notifications
 *
 * **Delivery mode** is decided at runtime by the `$job` system:
 * - If your app loads `AlephaApiJobsQueue` (and thus `AlephaQueue`), notifications
 *   go through the queue (best for high-volume systems).
 * - Otherwise, notifications run in **direct** mode: pushed to the outbox table
 *   and processed in the same process right after the HTTP response is returned.
 *   The reconciliation sweep is the safety net for crashes / retries.
 *
 * Direct mode is the recommended default for small / cheap deployments
 * (Cloudflare Workers, single-instance Node) - no queue infrastructure required.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ An app that uses the inbox owns its deletion cleanup
 *
 * `notification_inbox.userId` is a bare uuid with **no foreign key**: this
 * module imports nothing from `alepha/api/users`, so there is no table to
 * point at and nothing cascades. Deleting an account therefore leaves its
 * messages behind unless the app removes them.
 *
 * The seam is `user:delete:before`, and the call is
 * `NotificationInboxService.deleteForUser(userId)`. Put it in the handler
 * the app already has there, **after** whatever refusal that handler
 * performs: a separate handler can run first and wipe the inbox of an
 * account whose deletion is then refused.
 *
 * The hourly purge covers the other half, expiry, and only ever removes
 * messages that have been READ.
