 * Runtime-editable settings for the notification module.

 * Its own service rather than a field on `NotificationJobs`, because both
 * the jobs and the sender need to read it and `NotificationJobs` already
 * injects the sender: hanging the parameter off the jobs would close the
 * cycle.
 *
 * The parameter's `name` is unchanged, so values an operator has already
 * stored survive the move.
