 * domain's reputation survives contact with a real list.
 *
 * **Replay is a no-op by construction**, without an events table.
 * `suppress()` is find-then-insert and the receipt update sets a status
 * rather than incrementing anything, so the same event twice leaves one
 * suppression and one receipt. `eventId` is carried on the event for an
 * operator reading logs, not for correctness.
