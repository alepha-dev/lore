/**
 * OAuth 2.1 authorization server module for MCP.
 *
 * **Features:**
 * - OAuth 2.1 authorization code flow with PKCE (RFC 7636)
 * - Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591), deduplicated
 * - Authorization server metadata discovery (RFC 8414)
 * - Stateless authorization codes (short-lived signed JWTs)
 * - Single-use code enforcement
 * - Refresh tokens bound to the client they were issued to
 * - Device authorization grant (RFC 8628), with the page a human approves a
 *   device on
 *
 * **The device grant ships both halves.** `POST /oauth/device_authorization`
 * and the `device_code` token grant are the device's; `/oauth/device` is the
 * human's, and it is the `verification_uri` a device is told to print. It is
 * server-rendered HTML like the consent screen, sends a signed-out visitor to
 * `loginPath?redirect_uri=` and back, and refuses an answer posted from
 * another origin - see `OAuthController.deviceDecision` for why that check
 * matters more here than on the consent POST.
 *
 * **Registration is deduplicated, and that is what makes a "connected app"
 * a thing.** A client that registers again with the same name, the same
 * redirect_uris and no secret is handed the row it already has instead of a
 * new one. Some clients - claude.ai among them - run DCR on every connect
 * and never reuse an id, which grew a table of near-identical rows and, worse,
 * made one application look like four to anything grouping by `client_id`.
 * Reuse is refused for a confidential client, a revoked one, another realm,
 * a different redirect_uri set, and for any registration that named its own
 * `client_id` - see `OAuthClientService.register`.
 *
 * `oauth_clients.lastUsedAt` is written on every successful grant, and
 * `OAuthJobs.purgeAbandonedClients` collects DCR rows older than a day that
 * never received a token (`lastUsedAt` null) and no session references. A
 * client used once is never collected: some clients (ChatGPT) register once
 * and reuse that `client_id` for the life of the connector. Register it the
 * way `$realm` does; a job that mounted itself would run in every
 * application that imports this module.
 *
 * **The `refresh_token` grant requires `client_id`.** The client is looked up
 * and - when confidential - must present its secret, exactly as on the
 * `authorization_code` grant; the refresh token must then belong to a session
 * minted for that same client. A session with no recorded client (an ordinary
 * password login) is not an OAuth grant and cannot be refreshed here.
 *
 * This makes the id_token `aud` trustworthy: it is the authenticated client,
 * not an unvalidated request field. Without the binding, any refresh-token
 * holder could name any `client_id` and receive an id_token minted for it,
 * which a relying party that forwards id_tokens as its Bearer would accept.
 *
 * **Which redirect URIs a client may register.** `https://` to any host, with
 * at most one `*` standing for a single host label
 * (`https://*.example.com/cb`), or plain `http://` to the loopback interface
 * only: `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]` or `localhost`, compared on the parsed host. A
 * loopback redirect is matched on any port (RFC 8252 §7.3), since a native
 * app listens wherever the OS lets it; everything else is matched exactly. A
 * refused registration answers 400 with an RFC 7591 body, `error` being
 * `invalid_redirect_uri` or `invalid_client_metadata`.
 *
 * **Integration:**
 * Register the module and configure the realm + protected resource path:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const app = Alepha.create()
 *   .with(AlephaOAuth)
 *   .set(oauthOptions, { realm: "users", resource: "/mcp" });
 * ```
 *
 * @module alepha.api.oauth

   * one field initializer deep in a service. Since #Q2151 that incidental
   * registration decides the Cloudflare cache backend for the whole app -
   * `CloudflareCacheProvider` picks the database cache exactly when the
   * container has one - and a dependency that load-bearing must not rest on
   * a line somebody could tidy away.
