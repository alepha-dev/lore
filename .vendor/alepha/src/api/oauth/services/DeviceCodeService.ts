 * The device shows a short code, the human approves it somewhere with a
 * keyboard and a session, and the device polls until it does.
 *
 * **Stateful on purpose, unlike authorization codes.** Those are signed JWTs
 * carrying their own grant, which works because they are minted only after the
 * user has already approved. A device code is handed out BEFORE approval and
 * must later change state, so something has to remember it.
 *
 * That state lives in the cache: these records are short-lived by definition,
 * and losing them costs one re-run of `login`, which the user is standing right
 * there to do.
 *
 * ⚠ With the default in-memory cache this only holds for a single process. Run
 * more than one instance behind a load balancer and a poll can land on a node
 * that never saw the authorization — configure a shared cache provider
 * (`DatabaseCacheProvider`, Redis) before scaling out.
