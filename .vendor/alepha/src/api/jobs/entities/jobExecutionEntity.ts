/**
 * Job execution record.
 *
 * Stores durable state for queue-mode jobs (outbox pattern) and the terminal
 * record of every run a job keeps. How many rows of each status a job keeps,
 * and for how long, is its `retention`; the hourly trim enforces it, and
 * deletes the rows of any job name nothing registers.
 *
 * Status transitions:
 * - queue push            → pending (or `scheduled` if `delay`/`scheduledAt` was given)
 * - worker claim          → running
 * - success               → ok (or row deleted, when the job does not record successes)
 * - terminal failure      → error (or row deleted, when the job does not record failures)
 * - retryable failure     → scheduled (with scheduledAt = now; sweep picks it up)
 * - delay                 → scheduled (with scheduledAt = now + delay)
 * - handler reschedule()  → scheduled (next scheduledAt and payload, attempt reset, same id and key)
 * - sweep picks due ones  → pending
 * - cancel                → cancelled
