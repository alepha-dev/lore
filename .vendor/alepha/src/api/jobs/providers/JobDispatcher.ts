 *   .with({ provide: JobDispatcher, use: MyCustomDispatcher })
 *   .with(AlephaApiJobs);
 * ```
 *
 * The `kind` getter is read by the `JobProvider.effectiveMode` accessor

   * > a delay must **decline to enqueue** rather than enqueue immediately.
   *
   * That rule is the entire reason three backends at three capability levels
   * can share one interface with no `supports()` check anywhere in `$job`.
   *
   * "Decline" is not the same as "ignore". For a push transport, ignoring a
   * delay means **delivering now**, and for a retry that is strictly worse
   * than declining: declining leaves the row `scheduled` for the sweep,
   * while delivering now means zero backoff against a downstream that has
   * just failed.
   *
   * What each dispatcher does with it:
   *
   * - `DirectJobDispatcher` arms a local timer that promotes the row and
   *   then dispatches it. Exact on Node. **On Cloudflare Workers a timer
   *   armed after the response never fires**, so direct mode there cannot
   *   honour a delay at all and the retry keeps sweep granularity. Load
   *   `AlephaApiJobsQueue` if that matters.
   * - `JobQueueProvider` passes it to the backend, and falls back to the
   *   same local timer when the backend declines. Every backend that ships
   *   with Alepha honours a delay - Cloudflare Queues natively, Redis on a
   *   due-time sorted set, memory on a due timestamp - so that fallback is
   *   there for a custom one.
   *
   * Whatever happens, the row is `scheduled` with its own `scheduledAt`, so
   * nothing here can lose an execution: the worst case is that it waits for
   * the next sweep tick.
