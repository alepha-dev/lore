   * roughly 770 a day, almost all of them returning nothing. Most of the
   * hourly cron trigger's 172 ms of CPU was this.
   *
   * The group carries each status's count and its oldest `completedAt`, so a
   * status that is neither over its `last` nor holding a row older than its
   * `days` costs nothing more. `cancelled` is trimmed too, by the failure rule.
   *
   * **The clock is `completedAt`**, which every terminal write sets. Not
   * `startedAt`: it is null on a row cancelled before any worker claimed it,
   * and Postgres sorts that null first under `DESC` where SQLite sorts it
   * last, so the two databases would delete different rows.
