/**
 * Self-service "connected apps" — every OAuth client holding a live session
 * on the caller's account, and the ability to cut one off.
 *
 * ### Why it lives in `api/users` and not in `api/oauth`
 *
 * A connection needs both halves: a `sessions` row, owned here, named by an
 * `oauth_clients` row, owned by `api/oauth`. Either module could host it, and
 * the first attempt put it in `api/oauth` — reasoning that "OAuth mints
 * sessions for users" made `oauth → users` the natural direction.
 *
 * **That is backwards, and `yarn build` proved it.** `api/users` already
 * imports `api/oauth`: {@link $realm} pulls in `AlephaOAuth`,
 * `OAuthClientService` and `oauthOptions` to wire a realm's authorization
 * server. Adding the reverse edge produced
 * `Circular dependency detected: api/oauth -> api/users -> api/oauth` from the
 * build's "analyze modules" step.
 *
 * So the direction is fixed by what already exists: **users depends on oauth**,
 * and importing `oauthClientEntity` from `alepha/api/oauth` here is the same
 * edge `$realm` already relies on. It must stay one-way — a cycle is not a
 * lint warning but a crash, a primitive factory resolving to `undefined` at
 * class-field-init time, surfacing in an unrelated file.
 *
 * Cross-module imports go through the **package specifier**
 * (`alepha/api/oauth`), never a deep relative path: the same build step
 * rejects a relative import that leaves its module directory — *"Relative
 * imports must stay within the module boundary. Use a package import
 * instead"*.
 *
 * ### The UI gate is on the action, and no longer free
 *
 * `@alepha/ui`'s account router hides its Connections page behind
 * `listMyConnections.can()`, which resolves against `/api/_links`. While this
 * controller lived in `api/oauth`, an application that never mounted that
 * module got the page hidden for nothing. Registered here it is always
 * present wherever `api/users` is — which in practice is the same thing,
 * since `$realm` mounts `AlephaOAuth` anyway, but it is now a property of the
 * users module rather than a guarantee the placement provides.
