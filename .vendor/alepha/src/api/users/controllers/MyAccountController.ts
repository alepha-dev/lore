/**
 * Self-service account deletion.
 *
 * **This is a hard delete.** The account row, its identities and its sessions
 * go, through the same {@link UserService.deleteUser} the admin path uses —
 * one deletion semantic rather than two that drift. Soft-delete with a
 * bring-back window is a deliberate future decision, not an oversight; there
 * is no `deletedAt` on `users` to build it on today.
 *
 * ### Applications must opt in to what deletion means for their data
 *
 * The framework knows about users, identities and sessions. It does not know
 * that deleting an account orphans a project, or cascades through rows the
 * account holder authored inside *other people's* data — and it cannot,
 * because those foreign keys live in the application's own entities.
 *
 * So {@link UserService.deleteUser} emits {@link Hooks."user:delete:before"}
 * and awaits it before touching anything - on this path and on the admin one
 * alike - and an application subscribes with `$hook` to either clean up or
 * refuse:
 *
 * ```ts
 * class UserDeletionHook {
 *   protected readonly projects = $repository(projects);
 *
 *   onUserDelete = $hook({
 *     on: "user:delete:before",
 *     handler: async ({ userId }) => {
 *       const owned = await this.projects.count({ createdBy: { eq: userId } });
 *       if (owned > 0) {
 *         throw new ConflictError(`You still own ${owned} project(s).`);
 *       }
 *     },
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * An application with foreign keys to `users.id` that has *not* written such
 * a hook is relying on its own cascade rules being correct. That is a real
 * choice, and it should be a considered one — the failure mode is silent
 * third-party data loss, visible nowhere in a diff.
