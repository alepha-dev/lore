/**
 * Self-service profile — the "who am I" page of an account area.
 *
 * Counterpart of {@link AdminUserController}, scoped to the CALLER. There is
 * no id parameter anywhere in this class, and that is what makes the whole
 * surface safe to leave un-permissioned: `$secure()` proves a session, and
 * `user.id` decides the row. An operator reading someone else's profile goes
 * through the admin controller, which has its own permissions.
 *
 * Un-permissioned is also the only workable choice. Gating "read your own
 * name" behind a permission means every realm has to remember to grant it,
 * and the failure mode is an account area that renders empty for users
 * nobody thought to configure. {@link MySessionController} and
 * {@link MyPasswordController} already made this call; this follows them.
 *
 * The avatar lives in {@link MyAvatarController} instead, because it is the
 * one part of a profile a realm can switch off (`features.avatars`) and this
 * class is always registered. See that class for what went wrong while the
 * two were together.

        differs per backend (sqlite/postgres phrase it differently), so the
        translation is the fragile part rather than the check. Reading first

        and the loser gets a 500 instead of a 409, on a collision that needs
