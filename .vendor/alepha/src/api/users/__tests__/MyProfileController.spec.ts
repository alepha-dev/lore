      The reason this controller has its own schema instead of returning
      `users.schema`: `realm`, `enabled` and `version` are the operator's
      business. But the real risk is not today's three — it is that returning
      the row wholesale publishes every column added to `users` in future, on
      the day it lands, with nobody deciding that it should be.

      So this asserts the whole key set rather than spot-checking the three.
      Widening the response then requires editing this list, which is the
      deliberate act the allowlist exists to force. Verified by mutation:
      swapping the response schema for `users.schema` turns this red.

      The response schema is what enforces it — `$action` validates and strips
      on the way out — so the projection in `toMyProfile` is a second layer,
      not the guard. Assert against the endpoint, not the helper.

    A name field has THREE states a caller can express, and the difference

    first name and never unset one — the request succeeded, the response
    echoed the old value, and the UI toasted success. Nothing failed; the edit
    simply did not happen. It stayed invisible for as long as the profile page
    had no way to empty a filled box, which is exactly how long it lasted.
