/**
 * **Regression guard: `features.avatars` has to gate the endpoints, not just
 * the storage behind them.**
 *
 * `updateMyAvatar` / `deleteMyAvatar` used to live on `MyProfileController`,
 * which is always registered and injected `UserStorage` directly — so the
 * storage the flag was supposed to control got pulled in transitively and both
 * routes answered on every realm, including the default one where `avatars` is
 * `false`. The flag switched on a service nothing could observe. Nothing could
 * have gone red for it either: no test asserted on the *absence* of a route,
 * and `@alepha/ui`'s account page rendered its avatar picker unconditionally,
 * so the UI agreed with the wrong answer.
 *
 * These read the link registry rather than call the actions, because the point
 * is registration: an unregistered action is absent from `/api/_links`, which
 * is also what makes the UI hide itself with no second flag to keep in sync.
