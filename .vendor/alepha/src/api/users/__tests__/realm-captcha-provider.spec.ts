/**
 * A realm that requires a captcha nothing can verify is refused at boot.
 *
 * The old default was `MemoryCaptchaProvider` in EVERY environment, and it
 * accepts every token - so `captchaRequired: true` with no provider bound was
 * captcha theatre: the setting on, the widget rendered, and any string
 * accepted. The default outside test now refuses instead, which makes the
 * contradiction worth catching at boot rather than at the first signup.
 *
 * Which provider is the default in which environment is pinned separately, in
 * `captcha/__tests__/UnconfiguredCaptchaProvider.spec.ts`. Here the provider
 * is substituted explicitly, so this stays a test about the realm check and
 * not about `NODE_ENV`.
 *
 * Same home as the notifications contradiction (`RealmProvider.register`), so
 * both registration paths are held to it.
