/**
 * The name of a realm `$realm()` declares without `issuer.name`.
 *
 * It was `"default"` until #Q2264, and it is persisted: every user row
 * carries it in `realm`, every OAuth client in `oauth_clients.realm`, and the
 * realm's settings live in the `$parameter` `api.realms.<name>`. An app that
 * upgrades across the rename migrates those three (see the `users_realm`
 * migrations in this repo's apps), or pins `issuer: { name: "default" }` to
 * keep its old name.
 *
 * ⚠️ It is also the `users.realm` column DEFAULT, and on SQLite a changed
 * default is a table rebuild: the migration that moved it is hand-written as
 * UPDATEs, and the physical default on an upgraded database stays
 * `'default'`. Harmless, because every insert path writes `realm` itself.
