 * machine points at ONE Redis - `REDIS_URL: "redis://localhost:16379"` in the
 * `scripts/vitest.projects.ts` - so a literal name is shared state between
 * worktrees rather than a label. Two runs of the same spec register two
 * consumers on one list, and either may pop the other's message.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is a HAZARD found by reading, not the cause of anything measured.
 * It was written to fix `should push and pop with handler`, the most
 * frequent false red in `yarn v`, and it did not: two concurrent runs with
 * unique names still lost one. See the note in `testQueueHasConsumer` for
 * what the arithmetic actually says. Kept because a shared list across
 * checkouts is wrong on its own terms and costs nothing to close.
 *
 * The label stays in the name so a stray key in Redis still says which test
 * left it; the suffix is what makes it private.

   * seen five times in one session and once here under two concurrent runs,
   * but ten further attempts - six concurrent runs against twelve CPU hogs
   * at load 44 - were all green WITHOUT this line. So treat this as a
   * removed hazard rather than a proven cure: if the red returns, the poll
   * interval is no longer a candidate and the wake-up path is where to look.
