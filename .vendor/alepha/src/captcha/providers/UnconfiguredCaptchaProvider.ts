/**
 * The captcha provider an app gets when it registered none.
 *
 * Refuses every token. That is the whole point: the default used to be
 * {@link MemoryCaptchaProvider}, which accepts every token, in every
 * environment - so a realm with `captchaRequired: true` and no provider bound
 * had captcha "on" and no captcha at all, and nothing said so. A protection
 * that is absent must refuse, not wave through.
 *
 * The refusal is loud rather than silent: `verify()` logs an error naming what
 * to bind. Boot-time refusal is separate and lives with the code that knows a
 * realm asked for captcha (`RealmProvider`), because a container that merely
 * registered `alepha/captcha` without ever requiring a captcha is not
 * misconfigured and must still start.
