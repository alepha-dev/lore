/**
 * The string form of `shell.run()` passes every token through as a LITERAL
 * argument on both runtimes. Shell metacharacters do not compose commands —
 * that is the whole point of the POSIX single-quote escaping: `;`, backticks,
 * `$(...)` and `|` cannot break out of an argument.
 *
 * Review #2 recorded this as a Node-vs-Bun divergence ("shell features work on
 * Node, break on Bun"). That was true when it was written and stopped being
 * true when the escaping landed in its own third fix pass: Node now treats them
 * as literals too. `BunShellProvider.bun.spec.ts` asserts the same table, so
 * the two runtimes are pinned to one contract.
 *
 * Callers that need a pipeline should say so explicitly (`sh -c "a | b"`), and
 * callers passing untrusted values should use the argv form.
