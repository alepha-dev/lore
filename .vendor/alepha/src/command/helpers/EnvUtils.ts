   * - A bare `KEY` line with no `=` is ignored rather than setting an empty
   *   string, which is the difference between "unset" and "set to nothing"
   *   and changes what `$env` schemas do with it.
   * - A quoted value may span lines.
   *
   * **One deliberate divergence.** A double-quoted value is JSON-decoded
   * first, so escapes round-trip with a `JSON.stringify`-based writer (the
   * `.env.<env>.local` overrides do exactly that). When the body is not valid
   * JSON the quotes are simply stripped, with no escape expansion - dotenv
   * would turn the `\n` of a Windows path like `"C:\new\dir"` into a
   * newline, and that path is a real thing people write.
