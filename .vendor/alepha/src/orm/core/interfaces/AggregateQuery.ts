/**
 * How ONE aggregate operation is computed.
 *
 * `true` is the plain form: aggregate the key's own column, over every row
 * the query's `where` admitted.
 *
 * The object form adds two things, and either may be used alone:
 *
 * - `column` names the column to aggregate instead of the key. Supplying it
 *   turns the key into an **alias**, which is what lets several
 *   differently-conditioned aggregates over the same column coexist.
 * - `where` conditions the aggregate: it compiles into
 *   `COUNT(CASE WHEN <where> THEN <column> END)`, so only the matching rows
 *   contribute.
 *
 * ⚠️ `where` NARROWS, it never widens. It is ANDed inside the CASE while the
 * query's own `where` and the soft-delete filter still govern which rows the
 * aggregate sees at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ `COUNT(CASE WHEN c THEN col END)` also skips NULLs of `col` itself,
 * because that is what `COUNT(col)` does. For "how many rows match the
 * condition", point `column` at a column that is never null, such as the
 * primary key. Pointing it at a nullable column asks a different question -
 * a useful one, but a different one.
