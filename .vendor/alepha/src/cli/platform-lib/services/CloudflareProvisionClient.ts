/**
 * Creating the resources a Worker binds, from inside a Worker.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why this is not `CloudflareApi`
 *
 * Two reasons, and the second is a security one rather than a layering one.
 *
 * `CloudflareApi` injects `WranglerApi` for its token, which injects
 * `ShellProvider`, which reaches `node:child_process`. It can never enter a
 * Worker bundle.
 *
 * And its `resolveAccountId` falls back to `process.env.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`,
 * which inside Lore's Worker is **Lore's own account**, set for Analytics
 * Engine. A provisioning client that resolved its account that way would create
 * a user's D1 database in the operator's account and bill it to them. So the
 * token and the account id are constructor arguments, from the estate row, and
 * nothing here reads the environment. Same contract as
 * `CloudflareDeployClient`, which is the class this one stands beside.
 *
 * ## Raw `fetch` rather than the SDK
 *
 * The deploy client uses the `cloudflare` SDK because the SDK builds the
 * multipart script upload, which is the fiddliest part of that flow.
 * Provisioning is plain JSON, so the SDK would buy nothing and cost the
 * `D1`, `KV`, `R2` and `Queues` resource trees in Lore's bundle.
 *
 * ## It is also the migration transport
 *
 * `d1Query`, `d1Import` and `resolveD1Id` satisfy `D1MigrationTransport`, so
 * the migrate step of a Worker deploy runs through this client rather than
 * through `CloudflareApi`. ⚠️ The two D1 methods are **not** interchangeable:
 * see `D1MigrationsService` for what `/query` does to a table rebuild, measured.
