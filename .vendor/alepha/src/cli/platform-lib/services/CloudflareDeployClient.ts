/**
 * Deploying a Worker with no `wrangler` process.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Credentials are constructor arguments. Nothing here reads the environment

 * is a security one rather than a layering one. It injects `WranglerApi`, which
 * injects `ShellProvider`, so it never enters a Worker bundle; and its
 * `resolveAccountId` falls back to `process.env.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, which
 * inside Lore's Worker is **Lore's own account**, set for Analytics Engine. A
 * client that read its credential from the environment would deploy a user's
 * artifact into the operator's Cloudflare account.
 *
 * So the token and the account id come in from the estate row, at the moment of
 * use, and this file imports neither `CloudflareApi` nor anything that reads
 * `process.env`. `workerdEntryGraph.spec.ts` is what keeps that true.
 *
 * ## Seven calls, not one
 *
 * `wrangler deploy` does more than upload a script, and the last four are the
 * ones a naive implementation drops silently - crons stop firing, the custom
 * domain never attaches, the queue consumer never binds.
 *
 * 1. an upload session for the asset manifest
 * 2. one call per batch of assets, answering a completion jwt
 * 3. the script itself, with its bindings and the assets jwt
 * 4. cron triggers
 * 5. the custom domain
 * 6. the workers.dev subdomain
 * 7. queue consumers
 *
 * An eighth, `getSubdomain`, sits outside this sequence: it is the caller's
 * read of the account's subdomain to compose the address a domainless deploy
 * answers on, and it happens after the deploy rather than as part of it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Step 6 has **no save-time permission probe standing behind it**. The
 * workers.dev probe was dropped from #1630 because
 * `GET /accounts/{id}/workers/subdomain` answers error `10007` for an account
 * that never registered one, which a probe would misread as a missing
 * permission and use to refuse a valid token. "This account has no workers.dev
 * subdomain" is therefore a deploy-time fact, and since step 6 now runs on
 * every deploy it is REPORTED rather than thrown: by then the script is live,
 * and a Worker that is serving must not be recorded as a failed deploy over
 * the host it is additionally reachable at.
 *
 * ⚠️ Step 5 is `workers.domains.update` and never `workers.routes.create`. The
 * first is account-level and covered by the `workers` probe; the second is
 * zone-scoped and would need a probe no estate can run for a zone it does not
 * know. Wildcard hosts went away with the owner's 2026-09-06 ruling, so a Lore
 * deploy never emits a route.

   * The multipart upload itself, in the shape Cloudflare documents.

   * ## ⚠️ Hand-rolled, and the SDK's own `scripts.update` cannot do this
   *
   * Two things in `cloudflare@7` make that method wrong for a module Worker,
   * and neither announces itself:
   *
   * 1. It hardcodes `Content-Type: application/javascript` on a request whose
   *    body it then builds as multipart. Cloudflare believes the header, reads
   *    the raw multipart envelope as a classic service-worker script, and
   *    answers `Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token at
   *    worker.js:1:2` - a file nobody wrote, at the `--` that opens the first
   *    boundary.
   * 2. Its `getName` does `.split(/[\\/]/).pop()` on every part, so a module
   *    at `server/chunk.js` is uploaded as `chunk.js`. The entry still imports
   *    `./server/chunk.js`, and every build with a chunk directory - which is
   *    every non-trivial build - ships a Worker whose imports dangle.
   *
   * So the body is composed here the way `wrangler` composes it: one
   * `metadata` part carrying JSON, then one part per module **named by its
   * full path**. `headers: { "Content-Type": null }` deletes the SDK's
   * hardcoded value so the boundary the form generates is the one sent.
