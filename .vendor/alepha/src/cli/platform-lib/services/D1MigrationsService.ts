/**
 * Discovering, ordering, applying and recording D1 migrations.

 * ⚠️ **The transport is the D1 query API, not wrangler**, which is the whole of
 * #1514. Everything else here is unchanged from when it lived on `WranglerApi`:
 * both migration layouts, the deterministic ordering, wrangler's own
 * `d1_migrations` bookkeeping table, and the loud refusal when a directory
 * holds entries that are not migrations.
 *
 * Two reasons the transport had to move. A Worker cannot spawn a process, and
 * `orchestrator.up()`'s migrate step is the one part of a Cloudflare deploy
 * that shelled out. And reading the applied set back as JSON beats scraping
 * `--json` output with a regular expression, which is what the shell path did.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The transport is an ARGUMENT, not an injected field.** It carries a
 * Cloudflare credential, and inside Lore's Worker that credential belongs to
 * the estate being deployed to rather than to the process - the same reason
 * `CloudflareDeployClient` takes its token and account id in its constructor.
 * Injecting `CloudflareApi` here also made this service unreachable from a
 * Worker at all, since that class pulls in `WranglerApi` and so
 * `node:child_process`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The two transports are not interchangeable, and picking the wrong one
 * loses data silently.** A migration FILE goes through
 * {@link CloudflareApi.d1Import}, which is what `wrangler d1 execute --remote
 * --file` uses; the bookkeeping statements go through
 * {@link CloudflareApi.d1Query}, which is what `--command` uses. Measured
 * 2026-09-07 against a real D1 with a five-row CASCADE child: the query
 * endpoint kept 0 of 5, the import flow kept 5 of 5. `PRAGMA
 * foreign_keys=OFF` is void under the first and honoured under the second.

   *
   * An import is five round trips (init, upload, ingest, poll, and the
   * bookkeeping query), about 1.2 s. A first deploy of a club copy carried 26
   * migrations and spent 31.7 s of its 45 s run in this loop, so a new copy
   * paid most of its deploy time for round trips rather than for SQL.
   *
   * ⚠️ **Only for a database with nothing applied**, which is a first deploy.
   * Concatenation keeps every statement in its file's order and every file in
   * sorted order, so a rebuild's `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF` still runs before
   * the `DROP TABLE` it protects, inside the same import flow the class doc
   * says is the safe one. That is the argument, and it has not been measured
   * against a live database holding rows. A database with no migration
   * applied holds no application rows, so the incident this file is shaped
   * around cannot happen there, and every later deploy keeps the per-file path
   * it was measured on.
   *
   * The bookkeeping rows travel inside the same import, so the files and the
   * record of them land together or, since D1 rolls a failed import back, not
   * at all.
   *
   * `undefined` when a file does not end on a terminated statement: joined to
   * the next one it would merge two statements into one, so that set goes
   * the per-file way instead.
