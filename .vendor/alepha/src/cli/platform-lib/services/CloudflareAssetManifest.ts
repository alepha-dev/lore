 * The asset manifest a Workers deploy is negotiated with.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The hash is undocumented, and getting it wrong fails silently
 *
 * Cloudflare's docs say only "a 32 hexadecimal character hash". wrangler's own
 * implementation, read out of `wrangler@4.127.1`'s `hashFile`, is:
 *
 * ```js
 * blake3(contents.toString("base64") + extname(filepath).substring(1))
 *   .toString("hex")
 *   .slice(0, 32)
 * ```
 *
 * Three details, each of which is a silent bug on its own:
 *
 * - it hashes the **base64 of the content**, not the content;
 * - it appends the extension **without its dot**, and an extensionless file
 *   appends nothing;
 * - it keeps the **first 32 hex characters**, which is 16 bytes of a 32-byte
 *   digest.
 *
 * Get any of them wrong and nothing errors: Cloudflare simply never recognises
 * a file it already holds, so every deploy re-uploads everything and a laptop
 * deploy and a Lore deploy never share an asset. The failure is a bill and a
 * latency, not an exception.
 *
 * ## Why `@noble/hashes` and not `crypto.subtle`
 *
 * `crypto.subtle` has no BLAKE3, and wrangler's `blake3-wasm` carries a wasm
 * binary and is Node-only. `@noble/hashes/blake3` is pure JS and runs in a
 * Worker. Verified byte-identical against `blake3-wasm` over the real
 * `apps/lore/dist/public` tree - see `CloudflareAssetManifest.spec.ts`.

   * `Content-Type` as the one it serves the asset with. A part built from a
   * plain string carries none, so every asset comes back with an EMPTY
   * content type - and a module script with an empty MIME type is refused by
   * the browser under strict MIME checking, while the stylesheet beside it is
   * refused too.
   *
   * A prerendered site still looks correct at that point: the HTML is a file
   * on disk, so the page paints and only the JavaScript is missing. Measured
   * on `ui.alepha.dev`, where it read as "the deploy worked" for an hour.
   *
   * ⚠️ The table is small on purpose. It covers what a built web app ships,
   * and a missing entry costs one asset its type; pulling in a full MIME
   * database costs every deploy its bundle size, inside a Worker.
   *
   * ⚠️ **The fallback is `application/null`, and it is not a mistake.** It is
   * wrangler's, and its own comment explains why: a form-data encoder
   * replaces a falsy type with `application/octet-stream`, so there is no way
   * to say "no type" by omission, and the API parses this exact string to
   * mean send no `Content-Type` at all. Answering `octet-stream` here would
   * instead pin an extensionless file to a type that makes a browser download
