/**
 * A `PlatformAdapter` a Cloudflare Worker can bundle.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why `CloudflareAdapter` could not be this
 *
 * It shells out. `WranglerApi` for the token and the deploy, `node:crypto` for
 * the secret hash, `node:fs/promises` for the manifest. All of that is correct
 * on a laptop and none of it can be bundled for workerd, which is why the
 * `workerd` entry of `alepha/cli/platform-lib` registered no adapter at all
 * until this one.
 *
 * Composed rather than inherited, and from three pieces that already exist:
 * `CloudflareProvisionClient` makes the resources, `CloudflareDeployClient`
 * uploads the Worker, `D1MigrationsService` runs the migrations. This class is
 * the order they go in.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The order is folio #F1209, and it is the whole of `provision`
 *
 * A packed `wrangler.jsonc` carries **no** `d1_databases`, no `r2_buckets` and
 * no `vars`, deliberately: a build must not freeze a production database id
 * into stored bytes. So provisioning runs FIRST and the ids it obtains are what
 * `build` regenerates the config from. Skipping that and uploading the packed
 * config produces a Worker whose `DATABASE_URL` is absent - `alepha/orm` then
 * binds `NodeSqliteProvider`, `isServerless()` answers `":memory:"` before the
 * "DATABASE_URL is required" throw, and the only thing that saves it is
 * `await import("node:sqlite")` failing on workerd. Loud, but by one step.
 *
 * The ids travel on `BuildTaskContext.env` rather than through `process.env`,
 * which is #288's other half: two deploys share an isolate, and a global that
 * is saved and restored around a call is a race the second deploy wins.
