/**
 * D1 migrations must NOT go through `wrangler d1 migrations apply`.
 *
 * That command runs each migration inside a transaction — its own help
 * says "this migration will be rolled back" on error — and SQLite
 * **ignores `PRAGMA foreign_keys` inside a transaction**. drizzle-kit
 * opens every generated table-rebuild with `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF`
 * precisely so the `DROP TABLE` does not cascade, so under
 * `migrations apply` that pragma is void, constraints stay live, and the
 * implicit `DELETE FROM` behind `DROP TABLE` takes every child row with
 * it. The migration then reports success.
 *
 * Measured against a real D1, same migrations and same database:
 *   wrangler d1 migrations apply  ->  0 of 5 child rows survive
 *   wrangler d1 execute --file    ->  5 of 5 survive
 *
 * It destroyed 2434 rows across five tables in a production deploy before
 * being caught, so this suite asserts the shape of what is sent directly
 * rather than trusting a comment.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The transport is D1's HTTP API now (#1514), and WHICH endpoint is the
 * whole safety property.** Measured 2026-09-07 against a real D1, same
 * rebuild, same five-row CASCADE child:
 *
 * | endpoint | child rows after |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `POST .../query` | **0 of 5** |
 * | the `.../import` flow | **5 of 5** |
 *
 * `/query` voids `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF` exactly as `migrations apply` does.
 * So the assertion is no longer "no transaction was added" - nothing visible in
 * the request said which of the two was safe - it is **a migration file goes
 * through `d1Import` and never through `d1Query`**, with the bookkeeping
 * statements the other way round, which is what wrangler's own `--file` and
 * `--command` do.
