/**
 * A Worker deploy run twice against the same account.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why twice is the case that matters
 *
 * A Lore deploy is a `$job` (`DeployJobs` in `apps/lore`), and a retried or
 * rescheduled execution replays the whole run. So every step has to be safe
 * to repeat, and `DeployJobs` says it is: provisioning finds before it
 * creates, the asset upload dedups by content hash, the script upload is a
 * PUT, the queue consumer is found and rebound, and migrations are guarded by
 * the `d1_migrations` bookkeeping table. This file is what checks that.
 *
 * Twice means twice in full. A run that died halfway through a step - between
 * a migration's import and its bookkeeping row, say - is a different question,
 * and not one this answers.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Only Cloudflare is fake, and it is faked where the network is
 *
 * The run is built the way `DeployRunner` builds it - a container of its own,
 * the worker-side adapter registered by name, `PlatformOrchestrator.up()` in
 * prebuilt mode - and everything in it is real: the adapter, the build task
 * that regenerates `wrangler.jsonc`, `D1MigrationsService`, both Cloudflare
 * clients, and the `cloudflare` SDK under the deploy client.
 *
 * The fake stands behind `fetch` and answers Cloudflare's REST API, rather
 * than replacing a client. A fake shaped by `CloudflareDeployApi` agrees with
 * that hand-written interface by construction, and a client replaced by a
 * stub never runs its own find-before-create at all, so neither can say
 * whether a replay is safe. Its D1 is a real SQLite database, so a migration
 * applied twice fails the way it would there.
 *
 * It refuses what Cloudflare refuses: a second database, bucket, namespace or
 * queue under a name the account already holds, and a second consumer for the
 * same Worker on one queue. A replay that creates instead of finding fails on
 * its second run, which is the only way a test of idempotence can go red.
