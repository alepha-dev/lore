 * - **Binding/build vars.** The deploy target supplies these itself —
 *   `DATABASE_URL` from a D1 binding or Bay's managed SQLite, `SERVER_PORT`
 *   from whatever allocated it. Pushing the local value would point a
 *   deployed app at a development machine.
 * - **Framework infra knobs.** `LOG_LEVEL`, `DEBUG` and friends all have
 *   defaults, and a build manifest's `secrets` list surfaces every declared
 *   `$env` key — so they have to be excluded here to keep a CI runner's own
 *   environment out of the push.
 *
 * Lives on its own rather than on {@link CloudflareAdapter} because a second
 * adapter needs the same answer. Two hand-maintained copies of a list like this
 * drift silently: the copy that is missing a key does not fail, it pushes one
 * more secret than it should, and nothing says so until a deployed app is
 * reading a laptop's `DATABASE_URL`.
