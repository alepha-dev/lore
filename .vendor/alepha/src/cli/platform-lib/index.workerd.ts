/**
 * What `alepha/cli/platform-lib` is under the `workerd` export condition: the
 * orchestration, the naming and the config resolution, with no adapter that
 * shells out.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Deliberately a fraction of the Node entry.** Same reasoning as
 * `alepha/cli`'s own workerd entry: a name omitted here fails at BUILD time in
 * CI, which is where importing `WranglerApi` into a Worker should fail. The
 * three things this file cannot carry, and why:
 *
 * - `BayAdapter` and `WranglerApi` shell out (`node:child_process` through
 *   `ShellProvider`). A Bay deploy is a websocket command from Lore, not a
 *   local process, and `alepha platform up` on a laptop keeps both.
 * - `CloudflareAdapter` and `CloudflareApi` reach `WranglerApi`, `node:crypto`
 *   and `node:fs/promises`. {@link WorkerCloudflareAdapter} is what replaces
 *   them here, composing #1517's deploy client, #288's provisioning client and
 *   the migration service.
 * - `GitHubSecretStore` and `PlatformCacheProvider` read the disk.
 *
 * Nor does it export the `cloudflare()` and `bay()` factories: a factory
 * imports its adapter class eagerly. A Worker that deploys (Lore's
 * `DeployRunner`) writes a `{ adapter: WorkerCloudflareAdapter, options }`
 * descriptor itself, and a Bay deploy is a websocket command from Lore rather
 * than anything this container drives.
