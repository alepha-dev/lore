  /**
   * Build each vendored package in place, then make it resolve to what it
   * built.
   *
   * ## Why a vendored package has to be built at all
   *
   * `alepha vendor sync` copies the framework's **source**. Anything loading
   * `alepha/*` through Vite is fine, because Vite transforms it; anything
   * loading it OUTSIDE Vite gets raw TypeScript, and Node's loader cannot
   * cope. Two failures, and the second has no flag behind it:
   *
   * - `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_TYPESCRIPT_SYNTAX` on a parameter property, which
   *   strip-only mode refuses because it is a declaration plus an assignment
   *   rather than an annotation to erase. (A lint rule bans those in `src/`
   *   now, which is the other half of #Q2150.)
   * - `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` on `.tsx`, which Node refuses outright:
   *   JSX needs a transform, not an erasure. `alepha/react`'s barrel
   *   re-exports fifteen `.tsx` files across seven sub-barrels, `AlephaProvider`
   *   among them, so **any published package importing `alepha/react` is
   *   unloadable in a project that vendors the framework.** `@alepha/lore` is
   *   the first to do it and will not be the last.
   *
   * A published `alepha` never sees either, and the reason is `publishConfig`
   * rather than `files`: the repository's own `exports` map points at
   * `./src/**\/*.ts`, and `publishConfig.exports` overrides all 78 entries to
   * `./dist/**\/*.js` at publish time. A vendored checkout is a git clone, so
   * it gets the committed map and no `dist`. **It is the only shape of this
   * package that resolves to TypeScript.**
   *
   * ## Why in the consumer rather than in the clone
   *
   * The clone has no `node_modules`, so building there means
   * `install && build` on a whole monorepo per sync - minutes of network and
   * CPU. The consumer, by contrast, declares `.vendor/alepha` and
   * `.vendor/@alepha/*` as **workspaces**, so its own install has already
   * placed every devDependency the build needs, `tsdown` included. This runs
   * after that install and costs one build.
   *
   * ⚠️ **Order matters.** `packages/alepha`'s build GENERATES its own
   * `exports` map, pointing at `src`, so the transform has to come after the
   * build or the build undoes it.
   *
   * ## Why no package tsconfig extends the monorepo root
   *
   * In the consumer, `.vendor/alepha/../../tsconfig.json` is the CONSUMER's
   * root config: no `allowImportingTsExtensions`, and possibly
   * `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` or `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. So every
   * package tsconfig extends `alepha/tsconfig.base` (or, in `alepha` itself,
   * `./tsconfig.base.json`), which travels with the package (#Q2490).
   *
   * A package that fails to build is returned in `errors`, and
   * `alepha vendor sync` exits non-zero on it: its manifest still points at
   * `src`, which is the state this build exists to prevent.
