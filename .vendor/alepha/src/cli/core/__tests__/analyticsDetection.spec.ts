/**
 * Mirrors `r2Detection.spec.ts` for the Analytics Engine resource.
 *
 * `$analytics` (alepha/analytics) is a primitive, so the build can see it —
 * that is the common case and needs no escape hatch. But a workspace can
 * also already have `CLOUDFLARE_ANALYTICS_DATASET` set by hand in
 * `.env.production`, from before this mechanism existed (that hand-edit is
 * exactly what this feature exists to make unnecessary going forward), so an
 * explicit value must keep working as a first-class way to declare the need,
 * the same way `R2_BUCKET_NAME` does for `hasBucket`.

      comes from `alepha.dump().env` — the env keys of the graph as
      instantiated HERE, under node. `CLOUDFLARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN` is declared
      by `WaeAnalyticsProvider`, which only ever exists under workerd, so it
      was never in the list and `platform up` silently filtered it out of
      every push. The operator sets it in `.env.production`, the deploy
      reports success, and the worker boots without it — then throws
      "CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID and CLOUDFLARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN must both be set"
      on every analytics read.

      Exactly the hazard this file already documents for R2 bindings, one
