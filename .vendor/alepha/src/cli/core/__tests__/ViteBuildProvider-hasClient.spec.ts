      repo, and every server-only one started bundling its controllers for the
      browser: `"$action" is not exported by server/core/index.browser.ts`, out
      of a build that had been green for months.

      Shipped once already, in a fix that was correct for the app it was found
      in — which has a real `main.browser.ts` — and wrong for everything else.
