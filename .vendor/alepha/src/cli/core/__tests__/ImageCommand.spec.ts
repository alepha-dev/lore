/**
 * ⚠️ **The libc decision, which is where a compiled image goes wrong.**
 *
 * A Bun `--compile` binary is NOT fully static: the target triple picks the
 * libc. Put a glibc binary on `scratch` or on `distroless/static` (which
 * carries no libc at all) and the result is not a build failure — it is an
 * image whose binary exits immediately, with an error saying nothing about
 * why.
 *
 * So `alepha image` derives the triple from the BASE rather than inheriting
 * whatever `alepha compile` would default to, which is the host's libc and is
 * right for almost none of these.
