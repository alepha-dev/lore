/**
 * Object storage can be declared two ways, and only one of them is
 * detectable by introspection.
 *
 * `$storage` (alepha/api/files) is a primitive, so the build can see it.
 * But `alepha/bucket` also documents injecting `FileStorageProvider`
 * directly — "blobs without a database" — and that declares no
 * primitive. Worse, it cannot be inferred: the build introspects the app
 * under **node**, where `alepha/bucket` binds Local/Memory/S3, while the
 * hard `R2_BUCKET_NAME` requirement only exists in the **workerd**
 * variant.
 *
 * The result was a worker that built and uploaded but could not boot,
 * rejected with a bare `SchemaValidationError: 'R2_BUCKET_NAME' is
 * required` — after the migrate step had already run against production.
 *
 * So setting `R2_BUCKET_NAME` is a first-class way to declare the need.
