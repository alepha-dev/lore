 * Pack a built workspace into a deployable `tar.zst`.

 *
 *   public/               client bundle and prerendered HTML
 *   server/<runtime>/     one chunk directory per server slice
 *   index.<runtime>.js    one entry wrapper per slice
 *   manifest.json         what the build declared
 *   migrations/           SQL files (if present)
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The archive root is the CONTENTS, not a `dist/` wrapper
 *
 * `tar xf` yields `./public`, `./server`, `./index.node.js`, `./manifest.json`
 * and `./migrations` at the top. It used to yield `dist/` and `migrations/`,
 * and the manifest named the `dist` directory as its entry rather than a file.
 *
 * No compatibility alias is carried: Bay shipped its reader first, and every
 * artifact produced from here on has this shape. A consumer meeting the old
 * one should say so and ask for a redeploy, which is what Bay does.
 *
 * No source, no `alepha.config.ts`, no `package.json` — the deploy side reads
 * everything from `manifest.json` and never touches source.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ zstd, with a pinned window, and why that is not a detail
 *
 * A multi-slice artifact holds near-identical copies of the same bundle
 * megabytes apart. DEFLATE's match window is 32 KB, so gzip never sees the
 * second copy; zstd with long-range matching does, but only if its window is
 * large enough to hold both.
 *
 * Measured on Lore's node slice, duplicated (7.94 MB -> 15.88 MB raw):
 *
 * | | one slice | two slices | ratio |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `gzip -9` | 1.72 MB | 3.44 MB | **2.00x** |
 * | zstd, default window | 1.45 MB | 2.88 MB | **1.99x** |
 * | zstd, pinned `windowLog` | 1.45 MB | 1.47 MB | **1.02x** |
 *
 * At the default window the dedup silently does not happen and the archive is
 * twice the size it should be. Nothing fails, which is the entire reason
 * {@link ArchiveCompressor.WINDOW_LOG} is pinned explicitly AND the ratio is
 * asserted in a spec: a pinned value alone drifts as apps outgrow it, and an
 * assertion alone never sets it.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why this is a service and not just `PackCommand`
 *
 * `Alepha.inject` registers the module that DECLARES a service, through a
 * `[MODULE]` back-reference. So `$inject(PackCommand)` from outside
 * `alepha/cli` does not pull in one command: it registers `AlephaCli` entire,
 * and the injecting binary grows a `build`, a `dev`, a `db` and a `verify` it
 * never asked for. Measured, before this service existed: `AlephaCommand`
 * plus `inject(PackCommand)` reported 25 commands.
 *
 * This class lives in `AlephaCliServices`, which is command-free, so a caller
 * that wants to pack can inject packing rather than the whole CLI.
