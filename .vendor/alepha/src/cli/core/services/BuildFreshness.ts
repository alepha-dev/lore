 * Decide whether `dist/` still matches the sources it was built from.

 * builds and then runs something needing the build. `alepha verify` does
 * exactly that - `yarn build` for every workspace, then `yarn e2e`, whose
 * Playwright `webServer` starts each app with its own `yarn build && node
 * dist`. The second build re-produces an artifact that is already there and
 * has not changed, at ~12s per app per run.
 *
 * ⚠️ The obvious check - "does dist exist" - is worse than doing nothing.
 * Existence is not freshness: an app's bundle inlines its workspace
 * dependencies (lore's entry wrapper is ~109KB with an empty `dependencies`
 * map, the whole framework compiled in), so editing `packages/alepha/src`
 * leaves a present, stale, wrong bundle. A suite then passes against the
 * previous build and reports nothing. This compares mtimes instead, and the
 * clean/rebuild ordering elsewhere in the pipeline exists for the same reason.
 *
 * ⚠️ Nor can it be answered from the bundler's own output. Sourcemaps list
 * every input the server bundle consumed, but the client build emits no
 * sourcemaps at all, so a map-driven check silently ignores every
 * browser-only module. The inputs are derived from the dependency graph
 * instead, which covers both halves.
