/**

 * a precedence the API guarantees.
 *
 * Three of the shapes below were established by running vitest 4.1.10 rather
 * than read off its documentation, and each one is a case where the obvious
 * spelling is wrong:
 *
 * - `--coverage.reporter=json-summary` REPLACES the config's `reporter:
 *   ["html"]`, so the local HTML report disappears unless it is named again.
 * - `--reporter=json` alone REPLACES the default reporter, so CI keeps the
 *   file and loses every readable line of test output.
 * - repeated `--coverage.reporter` flags ACCUMULATE, which is what makes
 *   naming both of them work at all.
