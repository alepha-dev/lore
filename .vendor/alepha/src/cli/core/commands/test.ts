  /**
   * The vitest flags that turn a run into a pair of machine-readable reports,
   * written where every Alepha project already ignores them: `coverage/` is
   * vitest's own `reportsDirectory` and is gitignored by the templates.
   *
   * This is the convention half of `lore quality push`: the command
   * finds these two files without being told where they are, which is the
   * only reason it does not need a path argument.
   *
   * Every flag below is here because running vitest 4.1.10 said so, and the
   * obvious shorter spelling is wrong in each case:
   *
   * - `--coverage.reporter=json-summary` REPLACES the config's reporter list.
   *   Ask for the summary alone and the browsable HTML report silently stops
   *   being written, so `html` is named again here. Repeated occurrences of
   *   the flag accumulate, which is what makes naming both work.
   * - `--reporter=json` REPLACES the default reporter. On its own it writes
   *   the file and reduces the whole run's output to one line, so CI would
   *   trade every readable failure for a report nobody reads on a green run.
   * - `--outputFile.json=` is the keyed form. Bare `--outputFile=` names a
   *   path with nothing saying which of the two reporters owns it.
   */
  /**
   * `--project` for each name in a comma-separated list.
   *
   * A repeated flag is what Vitest itself takes, and a repeated flag is not
   * what this CLI parses: an array-typed flag here expects a JSON value, which
   * is no way to name two projects. So the list is one string on the way in
   * and one flag per entry on the way out.
   *
   * The values reach the shell as literal arguments, so a glob is passed
   * through rather than resolved against the working directory on the way.
   * That matters because selecting a workspace whole is a glob: a workspace
   * with browser specs owns both `<name>` and `<name>:jsdom`, and only
   * `<name>*` picks up the pair.
