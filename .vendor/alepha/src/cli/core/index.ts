/**
 * Services, providers, and build tasks — no commands.
 * Use this module when you need CLI utilities without registering commands.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The build tasks live here rather than in {@link AlephaCli}, and that is
 * the whole point of the split.** `Alepha.inject` registers the module that
 * DECLARES a service, through the `[MODULE]` back-reference, so a task
 * declared beside the commands would drag all twenty-five of them into any
 * container that injected one. `lore apps build` needs
 * {@link BuildCloudflareTask}; declared in `AlephaCli` that would grow the
 * `lore` binary a `build`, a `dev`, a `db` and a `verify` under a second name
 * and a second release cadence. `@alepha/lore`'s `commandSurface.spec.ts` is
 * the guard, and `commandSurface` here is the framework-side half.
 *
 * Neither obvious escape works, which is why the fix is which module declares
 * what: `getTopLevelCommands` subtracts by `children`, so hiding a command
 * that way republishes it one level down, and `hide` is read only by the help
 * renderer, so a hidden command still executes.
 *
 * ⚠️ Command-free is not the same as bundle-safe. This module still holds
 * `ViteBuildProvider`, so importing from it reaches Vite and `node:` builtins.
 * A Worker-safe entry point is #1513's job, not this split's.
