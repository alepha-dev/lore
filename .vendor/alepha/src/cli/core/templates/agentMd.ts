## Identity

This project uses the \`saas\` preset, so three routers from \`@alepha/ui\` are
registered in \`src/web/index.ts\` and mount pages of their own:

| Route        | Router          | Source                 |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| \`/auth/*\`    | \`AuthRouter\`    | \`@alepha/ui/auth\`      |
| \`/account/*\` | \`AccountRouter\` | \`@alepha/ui/account\`   |
| \`/admin/*\`   | \`AdminRouter\`   | \`@alepha/ui/admin\`     |

**These pages are not in \`src/web/\`.** Don't write your own login or admin
screen - extend the shells instead: \`$pageAdmin\` and \`$pageAccount\` add a page
to the existing nav in one call (take \`order\` 100-999 in your own \`nav.group\`).

\`/admin\` and \`/account\` are both **root shells** with their own sidebar and
topbar; \`/account\`'s menu carries "Back to site". Never put
\`AccountRouter.layout\` in your own layout's \`children\`: each shell mounts its
own \`Toaster\`, so every toast would show twice. Chrome (\`brand\`,
\`homeRouteName\`, \`extraNav\`, \`hide\`, page props) goes through
\`adminRouterOptionsAtom\` / \`accountRouterOptionsAtom\`, set with
\`alepha.set(...)\` from **both** \`main.server.ts\` and \`main.browser.ts\`. An
account page frames itself with \`AccountPage\` (\`variant="table"\` or
\`"form"\`).

\`src/api/Realm.ts\` is the switchboard for all of it:

- \`settings.adminEmails\` — the first registration matching one of these is
  promoted to admin. It reads \`ADMIN_EMAIL\`; init wrote your \`git config
user.email\` into \`.env\`, so registering with that address locally makes you
  admin. Every deployed environment must set its own \`ADMIN_EMAIL\`, and one
  that does not promotes nobody.
- \`features\` — \`audits\` and \`apiKeys\` are on; \`jobs\`, \`notifications\`,
  \`avatars\`, \`parameters\` and \`oauth\` each need a provider first. Turning one
  on registers its module _and_ makes its admin/account screens appear.
- \`verifyEmailRequired\` / \`verifyPhoneRequired\` / \`resetPasswordAllowed\`
  each need \`features.notifications\`, because each completes by sending a
  code. Setting one without it refuses to boot rather than running with the
  setting quietly ignored.

Pages hide themselves when the action behind them is missing from
\`/api/_links\`, so a missing nav entry means the module is not mounted, not
that the page is broken.

This is an **Alepha** project.

## Structure

Every Alepha project has the same layout. There are no variants — put new
code where this table says it goes. Directories marked \`(create)\` are not
scaffolded, because there is nothing to put in them yet; create them under
that exact name when you write the first file.

\`\`\`
src/
├── api/                  # Backend
│   ├── controllers/      # $action endpoints
│   ├── services/         # Business logic            (create)
│   ├── entities/         # $entity definitions       (create)
│   ├── schemas/          # Request/response schemas${
      opts.saas
        ? `
│   ├── Realm.ts          # $realm — auth settings & features`
        : ""
    }
│   └── index.ts          # ApiModule ($module)
├── web/                  # Frontend (React, SSR)
│   ├── components/       # React components
│   ├── AppRouter.ts      # $page routes
│   └── index.ts          # WebModule ($module)
├── main.server.ts        # Server entry
├── main.browser.ts       # Browser entry
└── main.css              # Tailwind entry
\`\`\`

\`src/api/\` and \`src/web/\` each have an \`index.ts\` exporting the \`$module\`
that groups everything below it — register new services there. The
subdirectories are plain folders; they have no \`index.ts\` of their own.

Tailwind is already wired up through \`vite.config.ts\` — style with utility
classes, don't add another CSS framework. The scaffolded home page renders
\`GettingStarted\` from the framework and carries no classes of its own, so
there is no house style to match: the first component you write sets it.

\`vite.config.ts\` also holds the Vitest config, under \`test\`. Don't add a
\`vitest.config.ts\`: one file keeps plugins and path aliases identical between
the build and the tests.

## Environment

\`.env.example\` is the committed list of variables; \`.env\` is gitignored.
\`alepha dev\` creates \`.env\` from the example on its first run when there is
none, as on a fresh clone, and never overwrites one: put your local values there.

\`APP_SECRET\` is not optional in production once the app signs anything
(sessions, tokens, signed cookies): it refuses to start without it, because the
built-in default is public and would let anyone forge authentication tokens.
Generate one with \`openssl rand -hex 32\`.

## Rules

- Always check \`node_modules/alepha/src/\` before suggesting npm packages
- Use \`z\` from Alepha for schemas (\`import { z } from "alepha"\`), never \`zod\` directly
- Use \`protected\` instead of \`private\` for class members
- Import with file extensions: \`import { User } from "./User.ts"\`

## Commands

\`\`\`bash
alepha lint              # Format and lint
alepha typecheck         # Type checking
alepha test              # Run tests
alepha build             # Build
alepha platform plan     # Show planned cloud topology (requires platform plugin)
alepha platform up       # Provision + deploy to a configured environment
alepha platform status   # Inspect deployed resources
\`\`\`
${saas}
## Testing

- Specs live in \`test/\`, named \`*.spec.ts\`.
- Run with \`alepha test\` (Vitest, embedded in alepha — nothing to install).
- \`test/dummy.spec.ts\` is the starting example; \`Alepha.create()\` is the
  entry point and \`.inject(...)\` resolves providers.

## Cloud deployment (Cloudflare Workers)

Add the \`platform\` plugin to \`alepha.config.ts\` to manage cloud
provisioning, deploy, secrets, and DB migrations end-to-end:

\`\`\`ts
import { defineConfig } from "alepha/cli/config";
import { cloudflare, platform } from "alepha/cli/platform";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    platform({
      environments: {
        production: cloudflare({
          domain: "yourapp.com",
          // jurisdiction: "eu",       // optional: EU data residency
        }),
      },
    }),
  ],
});
\`\`\`

Then: \`alepha platform up --env production\` (auth via \`wrangler login\` on first run).

Supported adapters: \`cloudflare\`, \`bay\`. The Cloudflare adapter provisions
D1 (or Hyperdrive when \`DATABASE_URL\` is postgres), KV, R2, Queues, and pushes
secrets via \`wrangler secret bulk\`. Set \`build.target: "cloudflare"\` in
\`alepha.config.ts\` if you only want the build artifact without the orchestrator.
