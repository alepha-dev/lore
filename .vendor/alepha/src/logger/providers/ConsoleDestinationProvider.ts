/**
 * Writes log lines to the console: stdout by default, stderr when the
 * container's store says `alepha.logger.stream` is `"stderr"`.
 *
 * ## Why the stream is read from the store, at write time
 *
 * A CLI's log lines are diagnostics, and its stdout is data: `alepha --version`,
 * help, a rendered result that a script pipes into `jq`. Sharing one stream
 * meant `cmd | jq` broke on the first warning, and a failure wrote its reason
 * where the data goes. So `CliProvider` moves its own container's logs to
 * stderr.
 *
 * It cannot do that by substituting this provider. The destination is chosen
 * once, in `AlephaLogger`'s `register`, bound `optional: true`, and the logger
 * is injected right there, so a substitution from a command module arrives
 * after the resolution it would have to change. The store is read live
 * instead, the way `alepha.logger.level` and `alepha.logger.format` already
 * are for `--verbose`.
 *
 * The store belongs to ONE container. An application container a command
 * boots in the same process (`alepha dev` does) keeps writing to stdout,
 * because an application's logs are its output wherever it runs.
