 * Coerce a single string value coming from a string-only boundary (HTTP query,
 * HTTP headers, environment variables) to the JS type its schema declares.
 *
 * This is the zod-standard `z.coerce` behavior applied only at the edges where
 * inputs are inherently strings. A JSON request body and the ORM stay strict —
 * both carry their own types — but the non-file parts of a MULTIPART body do
 * not, and are coerced here too: without it a `z.boolean()` or `z.integer()`
 * field is undeclarable in a form, since the wire can only ever deliver a
 * string for it.
 *
 * A value that cannot be coerced is returned unchanged so the subsequent
 * validation produces a proper rejection. Arrays coerce element-wise.

  // ⚠️ Scoped to the format literal, deliberately. `ServerProvider
  // .parseQueryString` answers `Record<string, string>`, so a query can never
  // produce an array on its own, and the general question - should EVERY array
  // query param comma-split? - is left open rather than answered here in
  // passing. Keying on `date-range` means no existing array field changes
  // behaviour and a value containing a comma cannot start splitting by
  // surprise.
  //
  // ⚠️ **A range reaches a server in TWO shapes**, and only one of them is the
  // one this was written for. `HttpClient.queryParams` `JSON.stringify`s any
  // object-valued query param, so the framework's own client sends
  // `?createdAt=["2026-01-01","2026-01-31"]`; a hand-written URL, and
  // `DataTable`'s own filter serialisation, send the comma-joined form. A
  // split that ran on both would cut the JSON in half and hand the schema
  // `["[\"2026-01-01\"", …]`, which fails as "Invalid ISO date" and names
  // nothing useful. So a value that opens with `[` is left to the JSON branch
  // below, which was already going to parse it correctly.
  //
  // Otherwise the pair is split and handed on unvalidated: a wrong count or a
  // non-date half is the schema's rejection to produce, and this file's
  // contract is that anything it cannot coerce is returned for validation to
  // refuse by name.
