/**
 * `$pageNav` already parented to {@link AccountRouter}'s `/account` shell:
 * the one-call form of "a page inside the shared account area".
 *
 * It carries the `$` prefix to sit with the framework's other declarations at
 * a call site, but it is a plain function wrapping `$pageNav`, which wraps
 * `$page`. Nothing about its lifecycle differs from declaring `$page`
 * yourself.
 *
 * The page appears in the sidebar with no separate registration: the layout
 * is `NavShell root="account"`, which walks the parent chain
 * and reads each page's own `nav`.
 *
 * **Calling this registers `AccountRouter`.** Declaring even one page this
 * way mounts the whole `/account` shell including its five built-in pages:
 * an account page without the account area around it is not a thing. That is
 * the intended reading, but it is a real side effect: an application wanting
 * `/account` to carry only its own pages must build its own layout instead.
 *
 * **Take an order between 100 and 999, in your own `nav.group`.** The
 * built-ins occupy `Account` (order 1) and `Security` (orders 1000-1003), and
 * `useNavEntries` sorts groups by their smallest member, so the application's
 * groups sit between the two: personal first, then the application, then
 * security. An order below 100 competes with Profile, one of 1000 or more
 * sinks the page in among the security pages.
 *
 * **Frame the page with `AccountPage`**: `variant="table"` for a `DataTable`
 * that fills the area, `variant="form"` for a centred column of cards.
 *
 * **Gate with `can: () => this.someApi.someAction.can()`, not `permission`
 * alone.** A permission named by this page's own `$secure` is self-declaring:
 * `$secure` registers it into `SecurityProvider` at definition time, so it
 * exists whether or not any controller backing the page does. An action name
 * resolves against `/api/_links`, which is built only from actions the server
 * actually registered.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * class OrganizationAccountRouter {
 *   protected readonly invitationApi =
 *     $client<OrganizationInvitationController>();
 *
 *   invitations = $pageAccount({
 *     path: "/invitations",
 *     name: "accountInvitations",
 *     nav: {
 *       label: "Invitations",
 *       // ⚠️ `createElement(Mail)`, never `<Mail />`. This module graph is
 *       // imported by `alepha db migrations create` under `tsx` with the
 *       // classic JSX transform, where the element form emits a bare
 *       // `React.createElement` and breaks migration generation for the
 *       // whole app - far from the icon that caused it.
 *       icon: createElement(Mail),
 *       group: "Organizations",
 *       order: 100,
 *     },
 *     can: () => this.invitationApi.getMyOrganizationInvitations.can(),
 *     // A lazy page framing `MyOrganizationInvitations` in
 *     // `<AccountPage variant="table">`: the component draws the table,
 *     // the page owns the frame.
 *     lazy: () => import("./AccountInvitations.tsx"),
 *   });
 * }
