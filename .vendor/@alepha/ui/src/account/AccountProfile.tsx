  /*
   * Does this realm have usernames at all?
   *
   * The avatar section above reads its switch through `can()`, because a realm
   * with `features.avatars` off registers no avatar action and the capability
   * is simply absent from `/api/_links`. That cannot work here:
   * `updateMyProfile` is the same call that saves first and last name, so it
   * exists in every realm and its presence says nothing about usernames.
   *
   * The realm's own `settings.username` is the switch, and `"none"` is the
   * only value that hides the row: it is the one that means this realm has no
   * such thing as a username, so there is nothing to show and nothing the user
   * could set.
   *
   * Without this, a `"none"` realm did not merely render a pointless field:
   * `?? ""` seeded an empty string into a column that is `.optional()` but
   * `minLength: 3`, `FormModel` decodes its initial values on construction,
   * and the whole page died at `useForm` with "Too small: expected string to
   * have >=3 characters at /username" — before anything rendered. `apps/examples/shop`
   * is such a realm, and `"none"` is also the framework default, so this is
   * what any new app hits first.
   *
   * ⚠️ `AuthRegister.tsx` excludes `"email"` here as well, and this
   * deliberately does not. In that mode `RegistrationService` derives the
   * handle from the address and drops whatever the client sent, so the
   * registration form is right to hide a field the user does not choose — but
   * the account page is where an existing, already-derived username is shown,
   * and `apps/lore` runs exactly this mode. Whether editing it there should be
   * possible at all is a real question (a rename desyncs it from the email
   * that produced it, and `updateMyProfile` does not re-run the slugger), but
   * it is a separate one from "this realm has no usernames", and answering it
   * by quietly deleting the field is not the place to start.
   */

  /**
   * Validated against the server's own body schema, so "3 to 30 characters"
   * is enforced before the request rather than only by the 400 that comes
   * back — and is stated in exactly one place.
   *
   * The schema stays whole and `username` is dropped from the *values*: the
   * column is `.optional()`, so an absent key decodes cleanly, while the empty
   * string does not. Omitting it from `groups` below is what hides the row —
   * `AutoForm` renders the fields its groups name and nothing else — and an
   * absent value is what keeps it out of the request.
   *
   * ⚠️ **`username` is never seeded as `""`, even when the field is shown.**
   * The old `?? ""` was not only a `"none"`-realm problem: `"optional"` is a
   * realm that collects usernames and does not insist, so an account without
   * one is the normal case there — and it crashed the page for exactly those
   * users while working for everyone who had set one. `undefined` is what an
   * empty optional field means, and it is what the two name fields would use
   * too if they were not `.nullable()` with a real "clear me" state.
