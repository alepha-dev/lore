      {/* The list is a bordered card whose rows are divided from each other,
          rather than a run of rows separated by whitespace.

          It replaced a single `border-t` above the list, which existed only
          to separate it from the header and had to be dropped when there was
          no header to separate it from (a top border with empty space above
          it reads as a clipped element). The card's own border does that job
          on every side, so the conditional is gone: the panel looks the same
          whether or not a title sits above it.

          `divide-y` instead of a border on each row: a border-bottom on all
          of them doubles up against the card's own bottom edge, and skipping
          the last one by hand is the rule `divide-y` already encodes.

          `gap-3` had to go with it. Rows that are spaced apart AND ruled show
          the rule floating in the gap rather than meeting the rows it
          divides; `py-2.5` inside each row is what carries the rhythm now.

          `overflow-hidden` for the corners: with nothing painting a
          background the radius is only on the border, but the first and last
          rows sit in the rounded corners and anything they gain later (a hover
          tint, a status band) would square them off.

          The tint is `bg-muted/40`, not `bg-muted`. The card once wore the
          table header's fold (`bg-muted` under a `--bevel` line on every
          row), and badges and controls inside a row came out the same colour
          as the card they sat on. At 40% the card stays a step below them. Plain `bg-muted/40` is not in the state-layer
          redirect in `styles.css` (only its `hover:` form is). */}
