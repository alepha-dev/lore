 * render ONE icon chosen from the color mode DURING RENDER, which is a
 * hydration mismatch on any PRERENDERED page: the HTML is built with the
 * default preference and the client renders the visitor's. React reported #418
 * on every cold load for anyone who had ever picked a mode, then threw the
 * prerendered tree away and re-rendered from scratch - most of what
 * prerendering was buying.
 *
 * `apps/docs` had already solved this by hand and wrote the rule down: the
 * theme is "a paint, not a render". The markup here is identical for every
 * visitor, and `.dark` / `data-color-mode` on `<html>` - both outside React's
 * tree, both set by `ColorScheme` - decide which copy shows.
 *
 * A mount gate would be the other way round, and it is wrong here: an app that
 * genuinely SSRs (Lore) already emits the right icon from the request's
 * cookie, so deferring to a mount would INTRODUCE the mismatch it is meant to
 * prevent. `withSystem` is a prop, identical on both sides, so branching on it
 * is safe.
