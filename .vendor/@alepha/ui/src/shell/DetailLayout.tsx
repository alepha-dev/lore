 * The shell every detail page shares: a full-height identity aside, and a

 * the right.
 *
 * It lived at `components/admin/admin-detail-layout` while admin pages were
 * its only consumers, and moved here when Lore's Epic page became the first
 * one outside admin. Nothing about it was ever admin-specific — it imports a
 * button, a segmented control and a skeleton — so the old name described the
 * callers rather than the component. There is deliberately **no re-export
 * left behind at the old path**: an alias nobody is forced to notice is an
 * alias nobody removes.
 *
 * It owns the chrome and nothing else. Data, forms and mutations stay in the
 * page that composes it, and each tab body is its own component that renders
 * what it is given — the split that keeps a detail page from growing into one
 * unreadable file.
 *
 * The aside is hidden below `md`. A phone gets the tabs full width rather than
 * a 288px column and a sliver of content; the same facts are reachable from
 * the tab bodies.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const [tab, setTab] = useDetailTab<"overview" | "stock">("overview");
 *
 * <DetailLayout
 *   aside={<DetailAside title={product.name} rows={rows} />}
 *   tabs={[{ value: "overview", label: "Overview", icon: Package }]}
 *   tab={tab}
 *   onTabChange={(v) => setTab(v as typeof tab)}
 *   actions={<Button size="sm">Publish</Button>}
 * >
 *   {tab === "overview" && <OverviewTab product={product} />}
 * </DetailLayout>
 * ```
 *
 * Dialogs belong beside it, not inside `children` — they portal out anyway,
 * and nesting them in the tab body unmounts them on a tab switch.

          a copy button, and read as undersized in a column that had room to

      {/* `min-w-0` is not decoration, and it is the horizontal twin of the
          `min-h-0` beside it. This column is a flex item on the row's
          horizontal main axis, so `min-width: auto` resolves to its content's
          min-content width and it refuses to shrink below it. A tab body
          wider than the viewport (the Questline board is `w-max`) then
          stretches this column past the viewport instead of overflowing
          inside it: the body's own `overflow-auto` sees a box as wide as its
          content and never scrolls, and the row's `overflow-hidden` simply
          clips whatever is past the edge, with no scrollbar to reach it.
          Measured on a 1276px viewport with a 16-card questline: without it
          the column is 3160px and `scrollWidth === clientWidth`; with it the
          column is 988px and the body scrolls 2172px. */}
      <div className="flex min-h-0 min-w-0 flex-1 flex-col">
        <div className="bg-background flex h-14 shrink-0 items-center gap-2 border-b px-4">

              `h-14`, so at 28px the control filled exactly half of it and
              read as a small thing floating in a tall bar.

              This does give up the pixel-for-pixel match with the toolbar's
              action buttons: all three consumers pass `size="sm"`, so the
              two were the same 28px before and are 28 vs 36 now. The match
              only ever held because both happened to pick the same token,
              and `actions` is caller JSX this component cannot size, so any
              increase here breaks it. Both are centred in a 56px bar, which
              is why 8px of difference does not show. */}
          {/* ⚠️ `min-w-0 overflow-x-auto` around the tab strip, and `shrink-0`
              on the actions. Without them the row is a non-wrapping flex line
              whose items refuse to shrink below their `whitespace-nowrap`
              min-content width, while the ancestor two levels up is
              `overflow-hidden` (deliberately, see the comment above it) and
              this row is `overflow-x: visible`. Everything past the right edge
              was therefore CLIPPED, with no scrollbar and no way to reach it.

              Measured on the epic view at 411x845: the row was 409 wide with a
              648 scrollWidth, and `Folios`, `Edit` and `Begin the Epic` - the
              page's primary action - were all off-screen and unclickable. 768px
              was worse, not better, because the 288px aside returns at `md`.

              The two classes split the row's shortfall deliberately. The tab
              strip is a bounded list this component owns, so it takes the
              scrolling; the actions are caller JSX this component cannot size
              (as the comment above already says), so they keep their full width
              and stay clickable. A tab strip that scrolls is a known phone
              pattern; a primary action hidden behind a scroll is not.

              The `no-scrollbar` class used elsewhere in this package is not
              defined anywhere in the repo, so the thin scrollbar shows - which
              is the affordance saying there is more to the right.

              `py-1` is not spacing: `overflow-x: auto` makes the computed
              `overflow-y` `auto` too, and without 4px of slack the segment's
              3px focus ring is clipped top and bottom. The row is
              `items-center` in a fixed 56px bar, so it costs no height. */}
