/**
 * The top-of-viewport bar that fills while a route transition is in flight.
 *
 * ### Mount it at the ROOT of the application, not inside a shell
 *
 * The bar is driven by `react:transition:begin` / `react:transition:end`, and
 * a component only sees an event it is mounted for. That makes the placement
 * load-bearing rather than cosmetic:
 *
 * - `begin` fires before the destination's layers are built, and `NestedView`
 *   commits the new view on `end`. So a bar living inside the page being
 *   navigated *to* is mounted one beat too late to draw anything for the
 *   navigation that mounted it.
 * - A bar living inside the page being navigated *away from* unmounts at the
 *   same commit, halfway through its own fade-out.
 *
 * The consequence is that a bar mounted per-shell covers exactly the
 * navigations that stay inside that shell, and silently covers none of the
 * ones that enter or leave it. A landing page with no shell therefore looks
 * broken relative to the rest of the app: every move within a section has a
 * bar, and the move into the section has none.
 *
 * Mounted once in the root layout, it is alive for every transition the
 * application can make, which is the only placement that has no blind spot.
 * {@link AppShell} still mounts one by default for applications whose shell
 * *is* the root; those pass `progress={false}` once they hoist their own.
