/**
 * The ambient controls as four buttons: language, theme, dark mode, account.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The kit's own shells no longer use it.** `AdminLayout`,
 * `AccountLayout` and Lore's header draw `ButtonSettings`, which folds
 * the three settings into the account menu once signed in, and renders this
 * same row with `placement="buttons"`.
 *
 * ### Why this is one component rather than four imports
 *
 * It was four imports, in three places — `AdminLayout`, `AccountLayout` and
 * `apps/lore`'s own header — and they had already drifted: admin rendered no
 * theme switcher, and Lore's account menu pushed a route that no longer
 * existed. A cluster that every shell rebuilds by hand is a cluster where
 * each copy is one refactor away from being subtly wrong.
 *
 * ### Each button decides whether it has anything to offer
 *
 * There is no "show the language switcher?" prop, and there should not be:
 * `ButtonLanguage` and `ButtonTheme` already return `null` at one or fewer
 * options, reading the real registry rather than a flag a caller has to keep
 * in sync. So an application with a single locale and a single theme renders
 * exactly two controls here, and gains the others the day it registers a
 * second — with no change at any call site.
 *
 * `ButtonUser` likewise renders a sign-in button when signed out and the
 * account menu when signed in, and `ButtonUser.AccountMenuItem` hides itself
 * when no `account` route is mounted.
 *
 * ### What it deliberately does not include
 *
 * Search. `AdminLayout` keeps its ⌘K trigger outside this cluster because the
 * Spotlight open-state is local to that layout, so a shared component could
 * never own it — and Lore's own search is a field-sized element that reads as
 * a different kind of control next to four icons. Pass it via `before` when a
 * surface wants it adjacent.
