 * stay lit while a user detail page is open. But it is a per-entry predicate,
 * so it cannot tell that a *different* entry matched more specifically.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. A page at `path: "/"` under a shell contributes no
 * segment of its own, and `ReactPageProvider.createMatch` collapses the result
 * (`/account` + `/` → `/account/` → `/account`), so its `match` comes out
 * **identical to the shell's**. The entry is then a path-prefix of every one of
 * its siblings, and lights up on all of them. `AccountRouter.profile` is
 * exactly this: Profile rendered active on Security, Sessions, API keys,
 * Connected apps and both Lore pages.
 *
 * Deepest-wins rather than a narrower "an index entry must match exactly"
 * rule, because the narrow version breaks the case the loose predicate exists
 * for: an index page that legitimately owns child routes of its own would stop
 * highlighting while one of those children is open. Comparing candidates keeps
 * both behaviours without either needing to know it is an index.
 *
 * Length is a safe proxy for depth here: every candidate is a prefix of the
 * same `current`, so of any two, the longer is under the shorter.
