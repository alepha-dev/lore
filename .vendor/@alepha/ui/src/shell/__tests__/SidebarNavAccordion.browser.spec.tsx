/**
 * `navAccordion` keeps one nav group open at a time, and it defaults to ON,
 * so every app using the shell inherits it. Two things are asserted here that
 * a screenshot cannot: that opening a group closes the one beside it EVEN
 * ACROSS `SidebarGroup`s (exclusivity is a property of the rail, not of a
 * heading), and that `false` still gives the older behaviour, where every
 * group keeps its own state.
 *
 * ⚠️ The icon assertions read lucide's own class (`lucide-plus` /
 * `lucide-minus`) rather than a `data-` hook of ours. That is the only
 * durable handle on which glyph rendered: both are inline SVG with no text
 * and no accessible name, so a spec asking for a role or a label would be
 * green with either one drawn.
 *
 * ⚠️ "Is the child in the DOM" is NOT the question, and asking it was how the
 * first draft of this file passed. A closed group stays MOUNTED so its height
 * can be animated, so the child text is always findable; what closes is the
 * wrapper, and `inert` is what takes the links out of the tab order in place
 * of the unmount that used to.
