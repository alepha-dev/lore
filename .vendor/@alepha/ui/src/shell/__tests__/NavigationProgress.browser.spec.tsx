/**
 * The bar draws for a transition it is mounted across, and for no other.
 *
 * That sounds like a restatement of how `useEvents` works, and it is - but it
 * is also the whole reason this component was pulled out of `AppShell`. Mounted
 * inside a shell, the two navigations it cannot cover are precisely the ones
 * that enter and leave that shell: `begin` fires before the destination's
 * layers exist, and `NestedView` swaps the view on `end`. An application whose
 * landing page has no shell therefore had a bar on every move within a section
 * and none on the move into one, which reads as a broken indicator rather than
 * as an absent one.
 *
 * These tests pin the contract a root mount relies on: silent until a
 * transition starts, visible for its whole duration, gone after it lands, and
 * still correct when a second navigation interrupts the first.
