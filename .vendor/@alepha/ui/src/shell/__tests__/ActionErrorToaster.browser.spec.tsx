/**
 * `ActionErrorToaster` is the single owner of the error toast: `AppShell`
 * mounts it, and it turns every `react:action:error` into one toast reading
 * `error.message`.
 *
 * That ownership is the whole point of the component, and it is what a call
 * site quietly takes back by catching its own failure, calling `toast.error`
 * and rethrowing - the rethrow still arrives here, so the same sentence lands
 * twice as two identical stacked toasts. `apps/lore/e2e/admin-user-detail`
 * caught exactly that on the admin profile form, where a refused duplicate
 * email matched two elements instead of one. A page that wants different
 * wording has `format`; a page that wants no toast at all has `filter`.
 *
 * Every test uses its own message text: sonner's toast store is module-level,
 * so what one test raises is still there for the next one to find.
