/**
 * The French catalogue must cover every `tr()` key in the package, exactly.
 *
 * Without this, the catalogue rots silently and in one direction only: a
 * component gains a key, nobody adds the translation, and the component falls
 * back to its English default — which looks deliberate. That is how the whole
 * back office came to be in English inside a French application in the first
 * place. A default is not a translation, and nothing but a test can tell the
 * difference.
 *
 * The check runs both ways. A missing key is an untranslated string; an extra one
 * is a translation for something no component asks for any more, which is dead
 * weight that makes the real gaps harder to see.

/**
 * Every key the package asks for, in either of the two forms it declares one.
 *
 * `tr("some.key"` / `tr(\`some.key\`` is the call site itself. `labelKey:` and
 * `groupKey:` are the declarative form the nav shell needs: a `$page`'s class
 * field is evaluated once, outside React, so a router names the key and the
 * sidebar resolves it later with `tr(nav.labelKey)` - a computed argument no
 * regex over call sites can read. Missing that form here would report every
 * nav translation as an unused extra, which is how a "coverage" check ends up
 * arguing for deleting the coverage.
