 * A closed range of calendar days, as one field.
 *
 * `z.dateRange()` makes both ends mandatory, so this control never writes a
 * half-range: `.optional()` on the schema is the only way to say "no filter",
 * and there is nothing in between.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The field is written on the second CLICK, not on the first complete
 * range**, and the difference is measured rather than assumed. The trap this
 * was written for is DayPicker handing back `{ from }` with no `to`
 * mid-gesture; react-day-picker ^10 does something else, which is worse for a
 * naive control: the first click answers `{ from: d, to: d }`, a complete
 * one-day range. A control that wrote whenever both ends existed would
 * therefore take the start date as the whole range and slam the popover shut
 * before the reader picked an end.
 *
 * So `pending` counts the gesture instead of reading its shape, and it
 * handles both behaviours: a genuinely half range holds, and a
 * DayPicker-completed first click holds too. `control-date-range.browser
 * .spec.tsx` drives two real clicks, which is what found this.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Local parts, never `new Date(value)`.** A date-only string is a
 * calendar day; parsing it as an instant shifts it by one west of Greenwich.
 * The two helpers are `control-date`'s own, shared rather than copied.
