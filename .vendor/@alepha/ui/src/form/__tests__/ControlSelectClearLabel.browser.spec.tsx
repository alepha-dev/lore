/**
 * Where a `clearable` field's label belongs: on the trigger, and nowhere else.
 *
 * ⚠️ This file used to assert the OPPOSITE of what it asserts now, and the
 * reversal is deliberate rather than drift.
 *
 * It was written when `ControlSelect` injected a synthetic clear ROW at the
 * top of a single-select's list, and when two render paths disagreed about
 * whether that row was a genuine selected value (full contrast) or a
 * placeholder (muted) - so the same filter changed colour the day its option
 * list crossed a threshold. Its cases therefore pinned "reads as a value, not
 * a placeholder" on both paths.
 *
 * Two things have since changed. The paths converged - the threshold now only
 * decides whether a search input appears, never which control you get - and
 * the clear row is gone: it said the same thing the trigger already says, a
 * second time, as a pickable option with a check mark, so "All states" read
 * as a third state rather than as the absence of a filter (feedback #2092,
 * then #2098).
 *
 * So empty is now EMPTY: `clearLabel` is the trigger's placeholder, styled as
 * one, and getting back there is either the `x` the trigger grows once
 * something is chosen or re-clicking the chosen row
 * (`ControlSelectDeselect.browser.spec.tsx`).

  /**
   * Why this button exists, stated properly.
   *
   * ⚠️ An earlier version of the component's own comment said the `x` had to
   * exist because `epics.spec.ts` went red when the injected "No release" row
   * was deleted. That is circular, and it is corrected in
   * `ControlSelect.tsx` and in that spec: it went red because its SELECTOR
   * named a deleted node, and re-clicking the selected release would have
   * fixed it in one line. A broken locator is not a usability finding.
   *
   * The reasons that hold:
   *
   * - re-click-to-deselect is counter-conventional, not merely quiet - in a
   *   native `select` and in almost every combobox, clicking the chosen
   *   option confirms and closes;
   * - "Reset filters" is all or nothing, and there is no per-filter escape;
   * - it costs nothing at rest, which the first case below pins.
   *
   * The last case pins the asymmetry rather than hiding it: `deselectable` is
   * `clearable || !meta.required`, so optional fields accept re-click and
   * show no `x`. `clearable` is the caller saying empty is worth ADVERTISING.
