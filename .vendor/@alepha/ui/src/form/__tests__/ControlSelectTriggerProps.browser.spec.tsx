/**
 * `Control`'s `inputProps` has to reach a select-shaped field's trigger.
 *
 * It used not to: the select branch forwarded `label`, `icon`, `clearable`
 * and `triggerClassName` and dropped `inputProps` on the floor. That is
 * silent in every way that matters, because the prop is accepted, typechecks,
 * and simply does nothing — so `inputProps={{ "aria-label": … }}` on the
 * epics and quests status filters named nothing at all for as long as it has
 * been written there.
 *
 * A filter is routinely rendered with `label=""` beside its own heading, and
 * then the trigger is a button with no `<label>` to borrow a name from. With
 * `inputProps` dropped it has no accessible name whatsoever: unreachable by
 * assistive tech, and unaddressable by `getByRole("combobox", { name })`,
 * which is how the admin analytics e2e finds its dataset picker.
 *
 * Asserted through `Control` rather than `ControlSelect`, because the gap was
 * in the hand-off between the two and a test on the inner component would
 * have passed throughout.
