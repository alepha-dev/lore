   * The `x` that puts a `clearable` field back to empty in one click.
   *
   * ⚠️ This is the affordance the injected clear ROW used to be, moved to
   * where it belongs (feedback #2098). Deleting the row made the empty state
   * a placeholder rather than a third pickable value, which is what the
   * report asked for.
   *
   * ## Why the `x` and not the row, stated properly
   *
   * An earlier version of this comment said the `x` had to exist because
   * `epics.spec.ts` went red when the row was deleted. **That was circular
   * and is corrected here.** The spec went red because its SELECTOR named a
   * node that no longer existed; the fix could equally have been one line
   * re-clicking the selected release. A broken locator is not a usability
   * finding.
   *
   * The real reasons, none of which that argument gave:
   *
   * - **Re-click-to-deselect is counter-conventional, not merely quiet.** In
   *   a native `select`, and in almost every combobox people use daily,
   *   clicking the chosen option confirms and closes. No learned model says
   *   it removes the value, so it is neither discovered by accident nor
   *   retained after being shown once.
   * - **"Reset filters" is not a fallback.** It is all or nothing. With
   *   status, area and release all set, dropping just the release is a
   *   different intent, and `DataTable`'s menu has no per-filter escape.
   * - **It costs nothing at rest**, since `showClear` needs a selection.
   *
   * ## No row comes back, at any size
   *
   * Feedback #2113 proposed a `None` row for `minimal`/`xs`, and the owner
   * dropped it the same day: this control had already been changed twice in
   * opposite directions, and keeping the row out leaves that sweep intact.
   *
   * ## And no `x` at `xs`
   *
   * At `xs` the trigger is 24px tall and the `x` a 12px glyph wedged between
   * the value and the chevron: too small a target to hit, and it crowds the
   * value it would clear. The owner took it out there. A `clearable` field is
   * always `deselectable`, so clicking the selected option again still puts
   * it back to empty, and the trigger still names the empty state with
   * `clearLabel`.
   *
   * ## `clearable`, not `deselectable`
   *
   * `deselectable` is `clearable || !meta.required`, so a large set of
   * optional fields accept re-click-to-clear and show no `x`: the component
   * holds both positions at once, that re-click suffices there and not here.
   *
   * That is a judgment call rather than a principle, and it is deliberate:
   * `clearable` is the caller saying empty is a meaningful state worth
   * ADVERTISING, so an ordinary optional field in a form keeps the trigger it
   * has today rather than growing a control for a state nobody is looking
   * for. Written down because it was previously undocumented, and an
   * undocumented asymmetry reads as an oversight to whoever finds it next.
