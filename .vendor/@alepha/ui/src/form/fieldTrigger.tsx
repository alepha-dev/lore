 * `chevron` targets the trigger's own last SVG - the one `ComboboxTrigger`
 * appends at a hardcoded `size-4`. It is sized from here rather than edited
 * there, because the size follows the trigger's size, which only this table
 * knows. A
 * date trigger writes its own chevron and lands on the same rule, since it is
 * that trigger's last SVG too.
 *
 * ⚠️ `clear` and `clearGap` are in this table for the reason feedback #2113
 * exists: they used to be the constants `right-8` and `mr-6`, tuned for the
 * default size. 32px is the default's right padding (8px) plus its chevron
 * (16px) plus a gap, so at `sm` and `xs` - where both shrink - the `x` stayed
 * 32px from the edge while the chevron moved left, and it landed on the
 * value. Anything positioned against the chevron belongs beside the chevron's
 * own size. Every row leaves the same 8px between the `x` and the chevron.
 *
 * - `clear` is the button's offset from the trigger's right edge, spelled as
 *   the negative margin that walks it back from there - see
 *   {@link ControlClearButton} for why it is a margin and not a `right-*`.
 * - `clearGap` is the margin that stops the LABEL running under it. On the
 *   label rather than in the trigger's padding: the chevron is the trigger's
 *   last flex child under `justify-between`, so padding the trigger walks
 *   the chevron inwards and leaves the button hanging off its right.

 * the `x` against the WRAPPER - and the wrapper is the `FormField`'s full
 * width while the trigger is only whatever `triggerClassName` made it. A

 * to the right of it, floating in the field's empty half. It stayed invisible
 * for a long time because the surfaces that narrow a trigger are filter bars,
 * where the fields carry `label=""` and no description so the box hugs the
 * trigger and the two edges coincide.
 *
 * The wrapper cannot fix that by sizing itself to the trigger: a trigger is
 * `w-full` by default, so a shrink-to-fit wrapper and a percentage-width child
 * size from each other and collapse to the text. Nor can the width be swept
 * onto the wrapper at the call sites - `triggerClassName` also carries skins
 * (`dt-input` brings its own border and padding), and a wrapper wearing those
 * draws a second box behind the trigger.
 *
 * So the `x` stops being positioned against a box at all: it is the trigger's
 * next flex sibling and walks back from wherever the trigger's own right edge
 * lands. No call site changes, and no width can ever be wrong again.

/**
 * The `x` that puts a `clearable` field back to empty in one click.
 *
 * ⚠️ Rendered BESIDE the trigger and drawn ON it, never inside it: a button
 * nested in a button is invalid, and Base UI's triggers - combobox and popover
 * alike - would swallow its click anyway. The wrapper is the caller's
 * {@link TRIGGER_WRAPPER_CLASSES} div, and the two are adjacent siblings,
 * which is what `[data-slot="date-trigger"] + [data-slot="control-clear"]`
 * selects on.
 *
 * ## Two steps left, and neither of them is a `right-*`
 *
 * The button is IN FLOW, as the trigger's next flex sibling, and walks back
 * over it from there:
 *
 * - `clear` from {@link TRIGGER_SIZES} (`-ml-8` at the default size) is the
 *   offset from the trigger's right edge, the one number feedback #2113
 *   tuned per size.
 * - `-translate-x-full` is the button's own width, which the margin cannot
 *   know: a flex item's margin places its LEFT edge, and the offset above
 *   describes its right one.
 *
 * That is one number more than `absolute right-8` needed, and it buys the
 * thing `absolute` could not have: the reference is the TRIGGER, not the box
 * around it (#Q2283).
 *
 * ⚠️ It also retires `MINIMAL_CLEAR_SHIFT`, and that correction was pointing
 * the WRONG WAY. It read the `-mx-1` in {@link TRIGGER_MINIMAL_CLASSES} as
 * putting the trigger's right edge 4px past the wrapper, so it moved the `x`
 * 4px right to follow. A block with `width: 100%` and a negative right margin
 * is over-constrained, so the browser drops that margin: the edge is 4px
 * SHORT of the wrapper, and the correction doubled the error. Measured in the
 * showcase, a minimal trigger's `x` ended 12px from its right edge with the
 * chevron starting at 16px - a 5px overlap of the two glyphs. In flow there
 * is nothing to correct: the margin moves where the next sibling starts, the
 * `x` follows, and every size and variant now leaves the same 8px gap.
 *
 * `relative` for the paint order alone: the button overlaps the trigger, and
 * a positioned element paints above a static one whatever the DOM order.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is the affordance the injected clear ROW used to be, moved to
 * where it belongs (feedback #2098). Deleting the row made the empty state
 * a placeholder rather than a third pickable value, which is what the
 * report asked for.
 *
 * ## Why the `x` and not the row, stated properly
 *
 * An earlier version of this comment said the `x` had to exist because
 * `epics.spec.ts` went red when the row was deleted. **That was circular
 * and is corrected here.** The spec went red because its SELECTOR named a
 * node that no longer existed; the fix could equally have been one line
 * re-clicking the selected release. A broken locator is not a usability
 * finding.
 *
 * The real reasons, none of which that argument gave:
 *
 * - **Re-click-to-deselect is counter-conventional, not merely quiet.** In
 *   a native `select`, and in almost every combobox people use daily,
 *   clicking the chosen option confirms and closes. No learned model says
 *   it removes the value, so it is neither discovered by accident nor
 *   retained after being shown once.
 * - **"Reset filters" is not a fallback.** It is all or nothing. With
 *   status, area and release all set, dropping just the release is a
 *   different intent, and `DataTable`'s menu has no per-filter escape.
 * - **It costs nothing at rest**, since a caller only draws it with a value.
 *
 * ## No row comes back, at any size
 *
 * Feedback #2113 proposed a `None` row for `minimal`/`xs`, and the owner
 * dropped it the same day: this control had already been changed twice in
 * opposite directions, and keeping the row out leaves that sweep intact.
 * The `x` is the one answer everywhere it is drawn.
 *
 * ## One accessible name, for every control that draws it
 *
 * `controlSelect.clear` names the key rather than the caller, and it stays
 * that way now that a calendar uses it too: the string is already translated
 * everywhere the kit ships, and renaming a key to match its widest consumer
 * buys nothing a reader ever sees. It replaces the two hardcoded English
 * labels the date controls carried, which is how a French app came to have a
 * "Clear date range" button in the middle of a translated filter bar.
