 * It lives here rather than in either application because two of them need the
 * same table. Lore renders it for a project's ranks; Alepha Club renders it for
 * the club's. What differs between them is entirely in the props.
 *
 * ## What the component deliberately does not know
 *
 * **It does not know what an owner is.** A column that must read all-on and
 * refuse edits is marked `readOnly` by the caller. Teaching the table about
 * ownership would put an application's model inside a component that two
 * applications with different models both use.
 *
 * **It does not know what a capability is.** See {@link PermissionMatrixProps.groups}.
 *
 * **It carries no copy.** Every label is a `ReactNode` the caller supplies,
 * already translated, so an application whose only locale is French renders a
 * French matrix without this package shipping a catalogue.
 *
 * ## The two kinds of locked row
 *
 * A permission can be non-negotiable in either direction, and both are common
 * enough to be data rather than a caller's own rendering:
 *
 * - `lock: "on"` is a **floor** - the permission every rank holds, so the row
 *   is checked everywhere and cannot be unticked (Lore's `project:read`: a
 *   member who cannot read the project is not a member).
 * - `lock: "off"` is a **ceiling** - the permission no rank may be granted, so
 *   the row is unchecked everywhere and cannot be ticked (Lore's
 *   `project:delete`, which belongs to ownership and is transferred rather
 *   than granted).
 *
 * A `readOnly` column beats both: an owner column reads all-on including the
 * ceiling rows, because the ceiling describes what may be GRANTED, not what
 * the owner has.
