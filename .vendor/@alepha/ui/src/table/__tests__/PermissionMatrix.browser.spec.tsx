 *
 * Two applications render this table for two different models: Lore hides the
 * permissions of a capability that is off, Alepha Club has no capabilities at
 * all; Lore has an owner rank, and the component must not. Each case below is
 * one of those boundaries, because a component that learns one of them is a
 * component the other consumer has to pass `undefined` to forever.
 *
 * Cells are addressed by the permission NAME rather than by its label - the
 * `aria-label` the component sets - so these say nothing about copy, which is
 * the caller's.
