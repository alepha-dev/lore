 * `defaultHidden` used to survive exactly one mount.
 *
 * The visible set was persisted by a mount EFFECT, so merely opening a table
 * stamped the current columns into `localStorage`. From then on the stored set
 * won, and a `defaultHidden` added to a column later did nothing for anyone who
 * had ever opened the page - silently, and with no stored marker to look wrong.
 * It also made the prop unusable as a controlled input, since a remount read
 * back what the previous mount had written.
 *
 * The write now happens on a toggle, which is the only thing that expresses a
 * reader's choice.
