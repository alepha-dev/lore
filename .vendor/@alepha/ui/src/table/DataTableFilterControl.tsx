/**
 * One filter's slot in a `DataTable` filter bar: the control, and the
 * cross that removes it.
 *
 * **One box, not a control with a button beside it.** The container draws the
 * border and the control inside is stripped of its own, so the remove action
 * reads as part of the field rather than as a separate thing that happens to
 * be adjacent - which is what a detached button looked like, and why it was
 * never obvious which filter a cross belonged to in a row of four.
 *
 * ```text
 * ( icon  Any status  ▾ │ × )
 * ```
 *
 * ⚠️ Three other designs were built and thrown away on 2026-09-12, and the
 * reasons are worth keeping so they are not re-proposed: a detached trailing
 * button (ambiguous ownership, and it truncated the control it sat beside); a
 * strip of actions sliding out from behind the control on hover (nothing
 * discoverable, and it overlapped whatever the page put above the bar); and
 * an always-present label row carrying the actions (cost a row of labels that
 * `label=""` exists to remove). This is what survived.
 *
 * ⚠️ The control's own `clearable` cross is HIDDEN here whenever this draws a
 * button. Two crosses a few pixels apart - one clearing the VALUE, one
 * removing the FILTER - is the ambiguity this design exists to remove, and at
 * this size they are the same glyph. It hides the affordance, not the
 * capability: the one button does both jobs in turn.
 *
 * Given neither `onClear` nor `onRemove`, it draws no button and hides
 * nothing, so the control keeps the cross inside its own field. That is the
 * search box: a filter that never leaves the bar has only one job for a cross,
 * and the field's own is the one every search box has.
 *
 * **The button is staged: clear, then remove.** A filter holding a value is
 * emptied by the first click and removed by the second, and the two acts do
 * not share a glyph: a cross empties the field, a struck-through funnel takes
 * the filter out of the bar. The destructive half is therefore never the one
 * a reader reaches first, and never wears the icon of the other - which
 * matters because emptying a filter is what they usually mean, and a filter
 * they configured and then lost to a stray click has to be added and
 * configured again.
 *
 * The stage is legible before the click from the icon, the tooltip ("Clear
 * value" against "Remove filter") and the accessible name, and afterwards
 * from the icon changing.
 *
 * ⚠️ The tooltip needs a `TooltipProvider` above it, like every other tooltip
 * in this package; `apps/ui` and `apps/lore` both mount one in their layout.
 *
 * The value has to clear through `onClear` rather than through the control,
 * because the container is given `active` and cannot reach into the field it
 * wraps - the caller owns the form.
