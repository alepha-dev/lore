 * of the row of filters, the row itself says what it adds, and the 36px
 * funnel read as one more toolbar tool beside the column picker. New filters
 * join the END of the bar, beside this button (see `DataTableFilterBar`).
 *
 * It exists because the bar now starts nearly empty. Showing every filter a
 * table supports spends the width of the bar on questions nobody has asked -
 * four boxes reading "Any status", "Any team", "Any role" say only that those
 * columns exist. So the bar opens with the search box alone and grows as the
 * reader asks for it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Renders NOTHING when there is nothing left to add, rather than a
 * disabled button. A button that cannot add is an affordance that has to be
 * tried before it can be understood, and the state it describes - every
 * filter already on screen - is fully visible without it.
 *
 * The caller owns which filters are shown; this only asks. It is also the
 * caller's job to open the new filter once it appears - see
 * `DataTableFilterBar`, which does both.
