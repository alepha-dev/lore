/**
 * The filter menu in the toolbar, on anything wider than a phone.
 *
 * It replaces the bare "Reset filters" icon button, for two reasons that
 * arrived together:
 *
 * - **Share needed somewhere to live.** A filtered table is a view worth
 *   sending to someone, and the address bar cannot carry it: the filters are
 *   never written back to the URL (see `fromQuery`, and Lore incident #156).
 *   So the link has to be something the reader asks for, which means an item
 *   in a menu rather than a bar that writes as you type.
 * - **Clear belongs beside it.** The two are one decision - this view, kept
 *   or dropped - and a menu is where a reader looks for both.
 *
 * The same `Funnel` icon as {@link DataTableFilterDialog}, on purpose: one
 * affordance for filters, whatever the width. Not its badge, though - see
 * `activeCount` for why the count stops at the phone.
 *
 * ## A table that cannot be linked gets the menu anyway
 *
 * Without `onShare` this is a menu of one item, which the toolbar used to
 * refuse: it drew a bare `FunnelX` button instead, on the grounds that a
 * menu costs a click to reach a button already on the bar. What that traded
 * away is the reason for the click. The bare button spends most of its life
 * disabled - Reset does nothing until a value is set or the bar is moved -
 * and a greyed icon with no words on it does not say whether it resets
 * filters, clears a search or empties the table. Behind the `Funnel` the
 * same state reads as "Reset filters", greyed, which explains itself.
