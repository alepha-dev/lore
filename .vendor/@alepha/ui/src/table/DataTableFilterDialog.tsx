/**
 * The filter bar, on a phone.
 *
 * Below `useIsMobile`'s breakpoint the bar's controls cost several rows of
 * height above a table the reader came for — three selects and a search box
 * stack at 412px — so they move behind this trigger and the bar itself is not
 * rendered (feedback #2106).
 *
 * Three decisions worth stating, because each had a plausible opposite:
 *
 * - **Not rendered, not `hidden`.** The controls are form-bound `Control`s, so
 *   a CSS-hidden bar plus a dialog copy would put two inputs on every field —
 *   duplicate ids, two labels pointing at one name. `DataTable` renders the
 *   filters in exactly one place at a time, which is why the switch is
 *   `useIsMobile()` and not a `max-md:hidden` class.
 * - **Applies on change, not on close.** The desktop bar refetches as you type
 *   (debounced, on the alepha event bus rather than on any DOM event — which
 *   is what lets these controls work identically inside a portal). Apply /
 *   Cancel semantics here would be a second behaviour for the same controls,
 *   and would mean the reader's filters behave differently depending on the
 *   width of their screen. Done just closes.
 * - **The trigger carries a count.** A button that looks the same whether or
 *   not three filters are narrowing the list turns a filtered table into one
 *   that looks broken, and on a phone the bar is no longer there to say
 *   otherwise.

          A filter bar sizes its slots for a ROW (Lore's `FilterSlot` is

          176px controls left-aligned in a 348px box read as a broken layout
          rather than a form. A descendant selector outranks the plain class
          on the element, so stretching them here costs no caller a change
          and leaves the desktop bar untouched.

          Two levels, because both shapes occur: slots directly under the
          form, and slots inside one wrapper the caller uses for its own
          `flex flex-wrap`. Deeper than that keeps its own width - a limit,
          not an oversight, since the alternative is a selector broad enough
          to resize things that are not controls.
