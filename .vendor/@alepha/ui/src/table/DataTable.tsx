   *
   * Every caller encodes its scope in that key - `lor.activity.${project.id}`,
   * `lor.epics.${project.id}` - so switching project changes it. Nothing acted
   * on that before, and `load` re-runs only on `[page, size, sortParam,
   * refreshKey, form, alepha]`, none of which a project switch touches. The
   * router does not remount on a param-only navigation either, so the table
   * kept serving the PREVIOUS project's rows under the new project's name
   * (feedback #2096).
   *
   * `refreshKey` is bumped rather than relying on the re-read: two projects
   * can share a stored sort and size, and then no dependency of `load` would
   * change and nothing would refetch. That equality is the bug's whole
   * mechanism, so the refetch cannot be a side effect of the values moving.
   *
   * ⚠️ Adjusted during RENDER, not in an effect, and that is load-bearing.
   * The sort effect (`useDataTableData`) and the column writes
   * (`useDataTableColumns`) are keyed on `persistenceKey` too, so on the
   * render where it changes they would fire in the same flush and write the
   * OUTGOING scope's state under the INCOMING key - silently
   * overwriting the project you just opened with the one you just left. React
   * re-renders before committing this, so by the time those effects run the
   * state is already the new scope's and they write back what was just read.
   *
   * ⚠️ `props.fetch` is still NOT a dependency of `load`. That is the loop
   * `fetchRef` exists to prevent, and several callers write a store atom from
   * inside their fetcher.
   *
   * Filter VALUES are deliberately not reset here: `useForm` captures its
   * `initialValues` once, so resetting them is form surgery rather than a
   * state assignment. They are also not clobbered - the filter-persist effect
   * writes only on `form:change` / `form:submit:success`, never on mount - so
   * the stored filters of the project you left stay its own.
