 * The tone each payment intent status wears, on the scale Lore's statuses

 * is `warning`, done is `success`, failed is `danger`, and `neutral` is a
 * settled state nobody needs to act on.
 *
 * ⚠️ `voided`, `cancelled`, `expired` and the two refund states are
 * `neutral`, where the old badge made the first three `destructive`. Each is
 * a flow that ended on purpose or by timeout, not a fault: the one status
 * that means something went wrong is `failed`, and it is the only red chip.
 *
 * A `Record` over the status union, so a status added to the entity is a
 * type error here rather than a chip that silently falls back.
