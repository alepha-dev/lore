 * Quiet on failure, like the bucket filter beside it: the page works without
 * its figures, and a store whose stats cannot be read is not news to toast
 * on every visit. It draws nothing until a read succeeds.
 *
 * ## One read, then the cache
 *
 * ⚠️ **This component mounts often.** It lives in the table's summary panel,
 * which is collapsible and remembers nothing: expanding it again rebuilt the
 * tile from nothing and asked the server for a `SUM` over every file row,
 * every time. The key shares one entry across those mounts and `staleTime`
 * serves it without a request, so toggling the panel is free.
 *
 * Ten minutes is long because the tile is a rounded total, not a ledger:
 * "230.0 MB" does not move visibly in that window.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A fresh entry means the query does not run at all**, deps change or
 * not, so `refreshKey` cannot refetch by being a dependency - it has to
 * remove the entry. That is what the effect below does, and it is why
 * Refresh, an upload and a delete still update the figures at once. Without
 * it the button would look like it worked and change nothing.
