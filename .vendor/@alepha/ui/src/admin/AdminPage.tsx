 * draws its own edge, so the `p-6` this used to be gave 24px down each side
 * to nothing (#Q2266).
 *
 * ⚠️ 8px is the frame of a TABLE page, not of every page. #Q2266 read it as
 * a back-office-wide rule and took the gutter off the card pages, the
 * dashboards, the form tabs and the release tabs as well, which was the
 * regression #Q2291 undid. A page whose body is cards or a form keeps `p-6`
 * (`p-4` in Lore): pass it as `className` here, the way `AdminDashboard`
 * does.
