 * `resolveUserDetailId` is the whole reason `~/git/club/apps/platform` keeps
 * working across a vendored `@alepha/ui` upgrade: it declares its user-detail
 * route as `/users/:id` against this same component, while `AdminRouter`'s
 * own route declares `:userId`. Losing the `:id` fallback would resolve an
 * empty id for that application instead of failing loudly.
