/**
 * The Action filter's value is the `type:action` key the Action column
 * prints, and the query takes it apart into both halves (feedback #2049: a
 * bare `create` selected every type's create at once). The key is looked up
 * in the fetched pairs rather than split, so a type carrying a colon is never
 * cut in the wrong place; the split is only the fallback for a key the list
 * no longer holds.
