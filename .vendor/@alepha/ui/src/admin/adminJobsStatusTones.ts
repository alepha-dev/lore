 * nobody needs to act on.
 *
 * ⚠️ `cancelled` is `neutral`, not a failure: somebody stopped it on
 * purpose, and tinting it like an error sends an operator looking for a
 * problem that is not there. The same call `skipped` gets on notifications.
 *
 * A `Record` over the status union, so a status added to the entity is a
 * type error here rather than a chip that silently falls back.
