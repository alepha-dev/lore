/**
 * The whole `/admin` surface, thirteen pages and their shell, mounted and wired.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Nav icons are `createElement(Icon)`, never `<Icon />`. Do not "fix"
 * them back to JSX.** This module is evaluated *eagerly* in the server graph:
 * `main.server.ts` → `$module` → `alepha.inject(AdminRouter)` runs these class
 * fields at import time, unlike every page below, which is behind `lazy()`.
 * `alepha db migrations create` imports that graph in a child process under
 * `tsx`, and `tsx` applies a single tsconfig resolved from the **cwd** — the
 * app root. A file outside that tsconfig's `include` (which this one is, being
 * in a sibling workspace) gets esbuild's defaults instead, and the default JSX
 * transform is the *classic* one. The emitted `React.createElement` then fails
 * with `ReferenceError: React is not defined`, breaking migration generation
 * for the whole app — with a stack that points here and explains none of this.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { AdminRouter } from "@alepha/ui/admin";
 *
 * export const MyWeb = $module({
 *   name: "my.web",
 *   services: [MyRouter, AuthRouter, AdminRouter],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Every page is mounted; none is conditionally registered
 *
 * A page whose permission the signed-in admin does not hold hides itself, and
 * so does a page whose module is not registered — but through two separate
 * gates, not one. Each `$pageNav` here declares `permission`, and its `can`
 * calls a typed `$client` action, and the entry is hidden when either fails.
 *
 * `permission` alone cannot cover "the module is not registered": `$pageNav`
 * wires it into `use: [$secure({ permissions })]` on the page itself, and
 * `$secure` registers that permission into `SecurityProvider` eagerly, at
 * definition time — so the permission exists whether or not any controller
 * backing the page does, and an admin holding the `*` wildcard is granted it
 * regardless. `can` closes that gap with an action instead of a permission:
 * `this.userApi.findUsers.can()` is `LinkProvider.can("findUsers")` against
 * `/api/_links`, a registry built from the actions the server actually
 * registered, so an action nothing declared never appears there for anyone
 * to be granted. The action is read off a `$client<AdminUserController>()`
 * field, so a rename on the controller is a compile error here rather than a
 * silently dead sidebar entry — the failure mode a plain string name would
 * have.
 *
 * This is why there is no `pages: [...]` allowlist. A second gate on top of
 * two that already work goes stale: an application that later registers the
 * audits module would still not see the Audits page until someone
 * remembered to edit the list.
 *
 * ### Extending the shell
 *
 * {@link $pageAdmin} (`@alepha/ui/admin`) is the
 * way to add a page to this shell — the one-call form an application, or a
 * satellite package such as `@alepha/commerce/admin`, whose pages
 * deliberately live outside this design system so it never depends on a
 * domain, reaches for:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * class ShopAdminRouter {
 *   products = $pageAdmin({
 *     path: "/products",
 *     nav: { label: "Catalogue", group: "Commerce", order: 100 },
 *     lazy: () => import("./AdminProducts.tsx"),
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * See `$pageAdmin`'s own JSDoc for the rules this composition must follow —
 * the `AdminRouter` registration it triggers, the `order` / `nav.group`
 * contract, and gating with `can` rather than `permission` alone.
 *
 * `layout` stays public as the seam underneath: `$pageAdmin` is exactly
 * `$inject(AdminRouter)` plus `parent: this.admin.layout`, done for you. An
 * application that wants that composition without going through `$pageAdmin`
 * — for instance to control itself whether and when `AdminRouter` gets
 * registered, rather than as an unconditional side effect of a field
 * initializer — injects `AdminRouter` and sets `parent: this.admin.layout`
 * directly, the same way `$pageAdmin` does internally.
 *
 * ### Labels are catalogue keys, not text
 *
 * Every `nav` here carries a `labelKey` (and a `groupKey` where it has a
 * group) beside its English `label`. A class field is evaluated once, at
 * construction, outside React - so a label written as `tr(...)` would be
 * frozen in whatever language happened to be active then, which is why the
 * whole admin chrome stayed English inside a French application while the
 * pages under it were translated.
 *
 * The keys are resolved by `navLabel` / `navGroupLabel`, which the sidebar,
 * the breadcrumbs and the palette all call from inside a component, so a
 * language switch re-labels the shell with no reload. `label` stays the
 * English text and becomes the `tr` default, so an application that registers
 * no catalogue sees exactly what it saw before.
 *
 * A page added here without a `labelKey` is untranslatable, and
 * `AdminRouter.spec.ts` fails for it.
 *
 * ### Group order is a contract
 *
 * The built-in pages are parked in a reserved high band: `Identity`
 * (1000-1003) and `System` (1010-1016). Everything below 1000 belongs to the
 * application, so a page declaring its own group at the conventional
 * `order: 100` sorts **above** the built-ins without having to ask — an
 * application's own domain outranks Users and Jobs. `useNavEntries` sorts
 * groups by their smallest member, so only an `order` of 1000 or more sinks a
 * page in among them.
 *
 * ### These thirteen route names are claimed globally
 *
 * `dashboard`, `users`, `userDetail`, `sessions`, `keys`, `jobs`,
 * `jobDetail`, `notifications`, `audits`, `files`, `parameters`, `payments`
 * and `analytics` each carry an explicit `name:` so a future rename of the
 * field itself (done for readability, without touching the string) never
 * silently changes the public route name — the same reason `AuthRouter`'s
 * pages all carry one too.
 *
 * Route names live in one process-wide namespace, and a duplicate does not
 * throw: `ReactPageProvider.page()` returns the first match. An adopter that
 * registers its own page named `files` (or any of the other twelve) either
 * shadows this one or is shadowed by it, silently, depending on mount order.
 * Treat these thirteen names as reserved when hanging pages off `layout`.
 *
 * ### It needs `<DialogProvider>` and `<Toaster />` above it
 *
 * Several admin pages call `useDialog()`, which throws without a provider,
 * and raise toasts. `AppShell` mounts both; a standalone mount, or `AppShell`
 * with `embedded`, has to supply them. `AccountRouter`'s JSDoc explains why
 * the shells deliberately do not mount them themselves.
