/**
 * Registering `AuthRouter` must be the whole integration.
 *
 * The four pages it mounts are what `@alepha/mantine/auth/AuthRouter` used to
 * provide before it was deleted with Mantine and not ported — which is why both
 * `apps/lore` and `apps/examples/shop` ended up rebuilding the same screens by hand.
 *
 * The paths are asserted literally because they are a contract, not an
 * implementation detail: the auth components fall back to exactly these strings
 * (`props.loginPath ?? "/auth/login"`), so a path drifting here would silently
 * turn every cross-link in the package into a 404. That failure is invisible to
 * typecheck and to any test that reaches a page by URL.
 *
 * The names matter as much: `$secure`'s redirect and `ButtonUser`'s sign-in action
 * both push a route called `login`.
