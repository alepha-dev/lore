 *
 * A pane closed with a click has to say how to reopen it. Collapsing to
 * nothing strands the reader: the only routes back left are a keyboard
 * shortcut and a menu that does not advertise itself, for a pane they just
 * closed with a click.
 *
 * It moved from Lore into the kit with #Q2265, so the admin Parameters
 * History panel and Lore's folio tree and inspector share one strip. Lore's
 * Quest Log rail is deliberately not built on it: there the whole rail is
 * the button and it carries a count badge, which makes it a different
 * control rather than a variant of this one.
 *
 * ⚠️ Render it only where the pane would otherwise be a COLUMN. Where a
 * layout stacks its panes or turns one into an overlay, a strip frees no
 * width and only changes the default layout.
