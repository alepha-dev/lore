/*
 * ⚠️ `disabled:cursor-not-allowed`, NOT `disabled:pointer-events-none`, which
 * is what this used to carry and why a disabled button showed a plain arrow:
 * an element with no pointer events is never a hit target, so it can have no
 * cursor of its own.
 *
 * Dropping it costs nothing. Base UI renders a NATIVE `disabled` attribute
 * here, and the browser suppresses click and mousedown on a disabled form
 * control by itself. Every other disabled control in the kit already relies on
 * exactly that - checkbox, switch, textarea, select, command, input-otp - so
 * the button was the outlier rather than the rule.
 *
 * `aria-disabled:pointer-events-none` covers the case the native attribute
 * cannot: a `nativeButton={false}` render, an anchor, where nothing stops a
 * click from navigating.
 *
 * The price is that a disabled button now takes its variant's hover fill under
 * the pointer, at `opacity-50`. That is deliberate, and it is what a disabled
 * `select-trigger` has always done. See the warning below for why the obvious
 * fix is worse than the wart.
 *
 * ⚠️ DO NOT guard the hover utilities with `not-disabled:`. It was tried, and
 * it broke the fill of every caller that overrides one - 94 call sites, of
 * which `useDialog`'s destructive confirm was the loudest: a red delete button
 * that turned near-white the moment you reached for it.
 *
 * The variant's classes and the caller's are reconciled by tailwind-merge,
 * which decides two classes are the same thing by utility group AND modifier
 * prefix. `hover:bg-primary/80` and a caller's `hover:bg-danger/90` match,
 * so the caller's replaces it. Prefix the variant's with `not-disabled:` and
 * they no longer match, both survive into the class list, and the browser
 * breaks the tie on specificity - where `:not(:disabled):hover` outranks a
 * plain `:hover` and the variant wins a fight it is supposed to lose.
 *
 * So: adding a class here is safe. Adding a MODIFIER PREFIX to a class callers
 * override is not. `cursor-*` has no overrides anywhere in the kit, which is
 * what makes the two above safe. `hover:bg-*` is the most overridden class in
 * it.
 *
 * `not-disabled:` on the `active:` nudge is fine for the same reason: the
 * press-down has three call sites and none of them override it. A disabled
 * button that sinks under the pointer is the one part of this worth
 * suppressing, since it promises a click that will not happen.
 *
 * `aria-busy:cursor-progress` wins while `loading`, which sets both attributes:
 * busy and forbidden are different promises. The work is happening, and the
 * button will take clicks again when it finishes.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ℹ️ A caller that overrides the font size DOES lose the line height with it,
 * and it does NOT move the label. Both halves were measured, because the first
 * one on its own reads like a bug and is the third-most-reported thing about
 * this file.
 *
 * `text-sm` is a PAIR in Tailwind v4: font size and the line height that goes
 * with it. tailwind-merge groups it with a caller's `text-[12.5px]` and keeps
 * only the caller's, so the pair's second half is dropped and the line height
 * becomes the 1.5 default - 18.75px rather than 20px. That much is real, and
 * `size="sm"` does it too, since it is `text-[0.8rem]`, also arbitrary.
 *
 * It cannot decentre anything. Half-leading is symmetric: the inline box sits
 * in the middle of the line box whatever the line height, the line box is
 * centred by `items-center`, and the fixed `h-8` is unaffected either way.
 * Measured on the reported button (Chrome, macOS, the same `-apple-system`
 * stack production resolves), ink centre against button centre:
 *
 *   text-sm         20px    line box   +0.404px
 *   text-[12.5px]   18.75px line box   -0.050px
 *
 * The override is marginally BETTER centred. What remains is the font's own
 * ascent/descent asymmetry, which is under half a pixel and is the same
 * effect at every size.
 *
 * So: do not add a `leading-*` here to "fix" it. It would change nothing
 * visible, at 94 call sites, on a base the notes above already record as the
 * risky place to edit. See #Q2157.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * 🧪 Experimental: Blueprint's two axes, `intent` x `variant`.
 *
 * `intent` is the colour, and says what the action MEANS: none (a neutral
 * grey), `primary`, `success`, `warning` or `danger`. `variant` is the
 * weight, and says how loud it is: `solid`, `minimal`, `outlined`, or
 * `link`, text with an underline on hover. Twenty combinations from nine
 * words, where the old list (`default`, `secondary`, `outline`, `ghost`,
 * `destructive`) mixed the two questions into one prop. The old names are
 * gone, not aliased.
 *
 * An omitted intent depends on the weight: a `solid` or `link` button is
 * `primary`, a `minimal` or `outlined` one is `none`. So a bare `<Button>`
 * is solid primary, and `variant="minimal"` is a quiet grey button without
 * having to say so.
 *
 * A solid button has VOLUME: a white gradient over its fill (a background
 * IMAGE, so a caller's `bg-*` replaces the colour and keeps the light), a
 * one-pixel highlight along the top edge, a border darker than the fill and
 * a short drop shadow. Hover darkens the fill rather than fading it, the way
 * Blueprint steps from its 3 to its 2.
 *
 * Every intent colour is a token (`--primary`, `--success`, `--warning`,
 * `--danger`, each with `-foreground` for text on the fill and `-text` for
 * the intent drawn as text on the page), so a theme retints them without
 * touching this file.
