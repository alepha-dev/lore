/**
 * A controlled tree: rows in, gestures out.
 *
 * ⚠️ This file is the DECLARATION only. The core lands in #Q1939, drag and
 * drop in #Q1940, rename and the menu slot in #Q1941. Every prop below says
 * which quest implements it.
 *
 * ## The contract, and why it is this one
 *
 * `TreeView` owns the row markup, the indent geometry and the memo. A
 * consumer supplies **render slots** (`renderIcon`, `renderLabel`,
 * `renderTrailing`, `renderMenu`) and turns capabilities on with flags.
 *
 * Render **functions** rather than `ReactNode`s carried on the node, for two
 * measured reasons. Lore's folder icon and the docs tree's folder icon both
 * need the row's collapsed state, which is row state and not node data. And
 * an element built per render changes identity every render, which is
 * exactly what defeats the row memo, while a function called inside the row
 * keeps every row prop a primitive, a memoised node, or a stable function.
 *
 * Stable **by construction**: `TreeView` wraps every callback and render prop
 * into one `useRef`-backed facade (the `implRef` pattern from Lore's
 * `useFolioTreeModel`) and hands rows that. A consumer passing inline arrows
 * still gets a memo that holds, and nobody has to rediscover `useCallback`
 * discipline.
 *
 * A `renderRow` escape hatch was considered and rejected: it hands out the
 * indent geometry and the memo contract, the two things that took the most
 * work and are easiest to break from outside.
 *
 * ## Two constraints for the docs tree, without declaring anything docs-only
 *
 * The label is its **own element**, separate from the row's click handler and
 * from the disclosure button, so rendering it as an anchor one day is a local
 * change rather than a rewrite of the row. `getHref` is deliberately NOT
 * declared: nothing in this epic implements it, and a declared prop that does
 * nothing is a lie in a types file.
 *
 * ARIA tree roles are built into the core (#Q1939) rather than opted into,
 * because they cost nothing and every consumer gains them.
