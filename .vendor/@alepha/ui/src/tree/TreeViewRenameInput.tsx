/**
 * The inline rename input that replaces a row's label.

 * ⚠️ **Its own component on purpose, and it must stay one.** Two reasons, and
 * the second is the one that bites.
 *
 * It calls `useI18n`, so a tree that never renames anything (a read-only
 * navigation tree, a docs file tree) would otherwise have to mount
 * `AlephaReactI18n` to render a single row.
 *
 * And mounting IS the draft reset. Inlining the input back into the row means
 * the row stays mounted across the whole rename, so `useState(name)`'s
 * initializer runs once for the life of the row and renaming the same row a
 * second time reopens showing the name it had before the FIRST rename. That
 * bug is why the row it came from carried a `wasRenamingRef` and React's
 * "adjust state during render" dance; a component that unmounts when the
 * rename ends needs neither. `TreeViewRename.browser.spec.tsx` pins the
 * second rename, so the bug cannot come back quietly.
