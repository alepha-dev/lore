 *
 * `@dnd-kit` is the house drag library in the applications that consume this
 * package (kanban boards, file browsers), and it is the wrong tool **here
 * specifically**. Three drop zones per row is about forty lines of
 * `onDragOver` arithmetic natively, against writing custom collision detection
 * for a library built around a single drop target per area. Recorded so it is
 * not re-litigated.
 *
 * A branch row splits **28% / 44% / 28%** into before / inside / after. A leaf
 * splits 50/50 with no inside area, because it cannot hold children.
 *
 * The row reports gestures and resolves nothing: `resolveDrop` is the
 * consumer's to call, because only it knows whether the resulting parent
 * change is legal in its own domain.
 *
 * ## Inline rename, and the context menu as a SLOT
 *
 * A row in rename mode swaps its label for {@link TreeViewRenameInput}. The
 * verbs of the context menu are never this component's business: it takes a
 * `renderMenu` slot and wraps the row in `ContextMenu` only when one is
 * given, so a consumer keeps its own menu with its own routes.
