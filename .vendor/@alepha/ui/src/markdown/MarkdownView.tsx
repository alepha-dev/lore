/**
 * Both parsers, both layouts (`graphre` for the flowchart, arithmetic for
 * the sequence diagram) and both emitters, pulled in ONLY when a document
 * actually contains a mermaid fence.
 *
 * This is the constraint the whole diagram layer exists under: a document
 * with no diagram must pay nothing at all. One with a diagram pays one
 * chunk once, then it is cached. Measured on 2026-08-28 with both diagram
 * types in it: 64.5 kB raw, **22.2 kB gzip**, 19.4 kB brotli - against
 * 17.95 kB gzip when it drew flowcharts only. If it ever passes ~26 kB,
 * split the two pipelines into two chunks so a flowchart-only document
 * stops paying for the sequence one.
 *
 * ⚠️ A lazy import a bundler decides to inline fails silently: the feature
 * still works and the cost moves into the entry chunk. After changing this,
 * build and confirm the diagram code is in a chunk of its own and the entry
 * has none of it:
 *
 *     yarn w lore build
 *     grep -rl 'addBorderSegments\|sequenceDiagram' apps/lore/dist/public/

/**
 * Renders markdown as formatted prose.
 *
 * ## Diagrams
 *
 * A ` ```mermaid ` fence containing a **`flowchart`** or a
 * **`sequenceDiagram`** is drawn as an SVG diagram instead of a code block,
 * themed from the app's own CSS variables so dark mode needs no second
 * palette. The renderer is in-house: only flowchart layout is imported
 * (`graphre`, dagre in TypeScript, ~15.5 kB gzip), and the whole thing is
 * one lazy chunk pulled in only when a document actually contains a fence,
 * so a document with no diagram pays nothing.
 *
 * The flowchart subset is `flowchart TD|TB|LR|RL|BT`; the four node shapes
 * `[rect]` `(rounded)` `{diamond}` `((circle))`, with every other mermaid
 * bracket pair consumed and mapped onto them; edges `-->` `---` `-.->`
 * `==>` `<-->` with labels in both the `-->|text|` and `-- text -->` forms;
 * chains, `&` fans, `<br/>` line breaks and nested `subgraph`.
 *
 * The sequence subset is participants and actors, the eight arrow forms,
 * notes, `autonumber`, self-messages and the `alt` / `else` / `opt` /
 * `loop` fragment boxes. Activation bars are ignored. A wide sequence
 * diagram keeps its natural size in a scroll frame rather than shrinking
 * into the prose column.
 *
 * **Everything else degrades to the code block, silently.**
 * `classDiagram`, `gantt` and mindmaps are not drawn, `style` / `classDef`
 * are ignored, and a parse failure, a refused construct or a diagram past
 * its cap renders the plain fence rather than an error. Agents write
 * invalid mermaid, and a red box in the middle of a document is worse than
 * a grey fence. See `packages/@alepha/ui/DOC.md` for the full table.
 *
 * ## Spoilers
 *
 * `||text||` renders as a covered box that reveals on click, on Enter or on
 * Space, Discord's syntax and Discord's behaviour. Inline markdown inside it
 * survives, a code span or a fence keeps its pipes literally, and an
 * unterminated `||` renders as the two characters the author typed rather
 * than swallowing the rest of the paragraph.
 *
 * ⚠️ **It is not a security feature.** The text is in the DOM from the first
 * paint, in the raw markdown, in an export, over MCP and in any search
 * snippet. It hides a plot point from a reader's eye and nothing more.
 *
 * ## Raw HTML
 *
 * No raw HTML is ever rendered as markup: react-markdown's default is to
 * escape a raw node to text, and this component deliberately mounts no
 * plugin that changes that. A narrow `rehypeSafeImg` plugin used to promote
 * a lone `<img …>` — the one thing MDXEditor emitted for a *resized* image —
 * and was deleted along with the editor that produced it, since nothing
 * writes that markup anymore.
 *
 * Do not reach for `rehype-raw` to bring the capability back: this renders
 * content authored by one user to another, so every raw tag becoming live
 * markup turns every markdown surface in every app into an injection point.
