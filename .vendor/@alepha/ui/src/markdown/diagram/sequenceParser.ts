/**
 * Parse the text inside a ` ```mermaid ` fence into a `SequenceModel`.
 *
 * Pure string in, data out: no layout knowledge, no DOM, no React. The
 * subset is mermaid's `sequenceDiagram` as agents actually write it -
 * participants and actors, the eight arrow forms, notes, `autonumber`,
 * self-messages, and the `alt` / `else` / `opt` / `loop` fragment boxes.
 *
 * **It never throws.** The caller's fallback is the original code block, so
 * anything unreadable returns `undefined` and degrades to the grey fence.
 *
 * ## Refuse vs skip, and why the line is where it is
 *
 * The test is whether dropping the construct would LIE about the diagram.
 *
 * - `par`, `critical`, `break`, `create`, `destroy` **refuse the whole
 *   diagram**. Drawing `par` branches one under the other asserts an
 *   ordering that is false, and silently wrong output is worse than no
 *   output.
 * - `rect`, `box`, `links`, `link`, `menu`, `style`, `activate` /
 *   `deactivate` are **skipped in silence**: decorative, or (for the
 *   activation pair) out of the v1 subset, and nothing semantic is lost.
 *
 * Structurally malformed input - an `end` with nothing open, a fragment
 * never closed, an `else` outside an `alt`, a `Note over` naming a
 * participant that appears nowhere - refuses the diagram too. Unlike the
 * flowchart parser, a statement is NOT degraded on its own here: a lost
 * message in the middle of a protocol is a wrong protocol.
