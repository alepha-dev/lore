/**
 * The lazy chunk's entry point, and the dispatcher between the two
 * pipelines: read the header, parse, lay out, draw - or hand back the fence
 * untouched.
 *
 * This is the ONLY module that pulls in either parser, `graphre` and either
 * emitter, and it is imported through `lazy()` from `MarkdownView.tsx`.
 * That is the whole constraint the diagram layer lives under: a document
 * with no diagram must pay nothing at all.
 *
 * **The two pipelines are parallel, not shared.** A flowchart ranks a node
 * graph and needs a layout library; a sequence diagram has both axes
 * decided by source order and needs none. Lifelines, ordered messages and
 * fragment boxes have essentially nothing in common with nodes, edges and
 * clusters, so one model type for both would make both halves worse. What
 * they do share is the text metrics, the theming, the marker namespacing,
 * the error boundary and the policy below.
 *
 * **Failure is always the code block, silently.** A parse failure, a
 * refused construct, a diagram past its cap, and a `classDiagram` all land
 * here identically. Agents write invalid mermaid, and a red error box in
 * the middle of a folio is worse than a grey fence.
