/**
 * Draw a laid-out sequence diagram as themed SVG.
 *
 * Everything the flowchart emitter settled applies here unchanged, and none
 * of it is optional:
 *
 * ## React elements, not an HTML string
 *
 * `MarkdownView.tsx` carries an explicit rule that no raw HTML is ever
 * promoted to markup, because it renders one user's content to another.
 * Emitting elements means labels are escaped by React itself and
 * `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` never appears on this path.
 *
 * ## Theming is the point
 *
 * Colours come from `--primary`, `--border`, `--muted-foreground`, `--card`
 * and `--muted` through `var(...)`, so dark mode works with no second
 * palette and no theme prop. That is the thing mermaid can structurally
 * never give us, and the whole reason drawing is our own code.
 *
 * ## The font is pinned, never inherited
 *
 * Folio view mode sets prose in Literata at 16.5px and lazy-loads it. The
 * width table is generated against Inter at `DIAGRAM_FONT_SIZE`, so
 * inheriting would make text and box disagree per surface and shift when
 * the serif lands. `fontFamily` / `fontSize` are camelCase, not the
 * hyphenated spelling: React renders the same SVG presentation attributes
 * either way, but hyphenated logs `Invalid DOM property` on every render,
 * from a component mounted on every markdown surface in the app.
 *
 * ## Unlike a flowchart, the width is natural rather than fitted
 *
 * A flowchart is roughly as tall as it is wide and scales into the prose
 * column. A sequence diagram's width is driven by participant count with
 * nothing to wrap, so scaling eight participants into a phone column puts
 * the labels at around 5px with no way for the reader to recover. So the
 * SVG takes its natural width and this component frames it in a scroll
 * container, with the keyboard affordances that come with one.

            THREE head kinds, not one. Epic #5 shipped a single end marker,

            three different statements about a message and each gets its own.

            in `<defs>`, so `currentColor` resolves against the MARKER's
            inherited colour rather than the referencing line's - the head
            came out `--foreground` while its line was `--muted-foreground`,
            and in a differently-themed container it was wrong outright.
